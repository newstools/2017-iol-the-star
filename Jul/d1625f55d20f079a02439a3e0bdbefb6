“This man has been convicted. All his appeals have been turned down, so therefore it is the job of the police to arrest him and take him to the Department of Correctional Services to serve his sentence,” Dr Rishigen Viranna, the party’s spokesperson on community safety and liaison in the province, said yesterday. Mdunge is supposed to be serving a five-year prison term for fraud but weeks after his latest appeal was dismissed, he is still not in jail. In 2014, the Durban Regional Court convicted Mdunge of using a fake matric certificate to advance his career within the SAPS and to further his studies. He was convicted on one count of fraud for receiving a salary to which he was not entitled and another for submitting his forged matric certificate to Unisa. In February, the high court in Pietermaritzburg dismissed a bid to overturn his conviction and sentence. Last month, the Supreme Court of Appeals dismissed another bid to the same effect. But police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said yesterday that they had done their job and that they could only arrest Mdunge with a warrant from the court. Mdunge’s lawyer, Yusuf Omar, said yesterday that he’d been told not to comment.

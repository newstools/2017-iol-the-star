He said: “When I see the meaningful way in which these social change-makers have turned nothing into something, I too begin to believe that we can create a better world.

Through their stories, which include castor oil production in the making of biodiesel and free legal advice for female victims of abuse, the award-winning rapper will promote their positive efforts that often go unnoticed. “If you are not doing anything to change anyone’s life, then what’s the point? Set your soul on fire and contribute,” he said. “The world is waiting. Your awakening, your journey. The awakening begins when you recognise the fire in you.” The documentary starts airing on Sunday.

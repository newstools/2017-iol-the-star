The residents were moved to temporary accommodation at the Wembley Stadium. They claim some of their children have already missed school and that there is not enough food. There are more than 15 tents in the stadium. Beds and mattresses are scattered over the grounds and in some tents, the interior is divided by mattresses with clothes hanging from the top of the tents, giving the occupants some privacy. In some cases, females and males are forced to share tents. Thobisa Mgibanthaka, one of the residents evicted by the Red Ants last week, recalled her ordeal when all her belongings were taken away from her as “horrible and unbearable”. She has a five-year-old son who is suffering from macrocephaly. Mgibanthaka said she needed help as she could not provide for her son, and the living conditions made it more difficult for her to care for him. In addition, all his medication was taken from her when she was evicted from Fattis Mansion in Joburg. “It’s very cold here I’m only concerned about my child, he’s been losing a lot of weight,” said Mgibanthaka. She hails from the Eastern Cape and has no family to help her in Joburg. She said she came to the city in search of work. * Steve, who wishes to remain anonymous, has been helping the residents camped at Wembley Stadium by providing them with food and water and by taking the children to school. The residents said Steve was the only person to have come to their rescue. They added that the government had failed to provide them with proper temporary accommodation. Steve said he knew all the residents of Fattis Mansion and had been working with them for a long time. “The living conditions are unbearable. Most of the people here lost their identity documents and their children are wandering around without any uniform to wear to go to school,” said Steve. He said the residents had slept in the streets for two days after they were evicted and the government had acted only two days later. * Not his real name

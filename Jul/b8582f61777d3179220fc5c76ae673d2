All payments made to the old account will be redirected to the new account. The city has a contract with Nedbank, which has been effective since September 2015, following a tender process that was awarded in the metro's 2015/16 financial year. To minimise the inconvenience to over 3 million Ekurhuleni customers, payments made into Absa, Standard Bank and First National Bank accounts are still received and recorded, as these accounts have not been closed. Customers who prefer to pay via electronic funds transfer can do so through most banks - Nedbank, Absa, Standard Bank and FNB branches across Ekurhuleni. Alternatively, payments can also be made via the e-siyakhokha online payment system at www.
e-siyakhokha.co.za and at third party vendors such as Checkers and Pick *  Pay. - Anna Cox

A biochemist has coined the phrase “Rushing woman syndrome” to describe women permanently on the brink of burnout. Here, two moms who freely admit they are addicted to being busy, and average more than 100 hours a week at the coalface of work, motherhood and hobbies, relate why they simply refuse to take a rest.  DIVORCE MADE ME Victoria Bolden, 46, is a teacher. She is divorced with four children, Henry, 17, Charlie, 14, and 10-year-old twins Philippa and Gabrielle. She has been with her boyfriend Andrew, a 50-year-old recruitment consultant, for 18 months. Victoria says: During the painful aftermath of my husband leaving me, I resolved to keep myself and my four children extra busy with activities to enjoy, which I spread across two diaries: one paper and one electronic. So, slotted around working full-time as a teacher, I was taxi-ing the children hundreds of kilometres a month to flute and saxophone lessons, cricket, football and athletics clubs, air cadets, choir, street- dance classes, gymnastics and orchestra practice. I also fit in weekly classes of Zumba and PiYo - a combination of yoga and pilates - and a monthly book club. Twice a month I host dinner parties for groups of up to 14 friends, always with at least three courses. During school breaks I “dog sit” for a friend, and I’m just putting the finishing touches to a planned two-week holiday with the kids to Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York this summer. Friends ask me all the time, “How do you do it?” And some describe me as being a real-life Wonder Woman. But being busy comes naturally to me.

I LOVE THE CHAOS Alison McGeehan, 36, is head of maths in a secondary school and lives with her husband Jon, also 36, a process engineer, and their children William, 9, and Tillie, 7. Alison says: There are moms who seem to be competitively busy, but I don’t fill my diary to earn bragging rights. I’m naturally compelled to be on the go. My parents were the same, always throwing themselves into helping behind the scenes at whatever sporting clubs my two sisters and I were involved in. My husband had a similarly busy upbringing. I was sensible, I chose a man fully signed up to the chaos. Aside from my teaching career and ferrying the kids to and from all their activities, I do private tutoring and revision classes, 
I take part in triathlons and the time I play netball is sacrosanct. I love trying new things to save. I recently made new curtains for the kids’ bedrooms, having taught myself to sew. But being so busy forces me to be savvy and strict. I won’t accommodate any fussy eating at mealtimes - we all eat the same food at the same time. I sit and mark maths homework while waiting for my kids to finish their swimming lessons, and I run while my daughter is playing netball. Even though it’s exhausting, pursuing my own interests as well as encouraging my children in theirs keeps me sane.

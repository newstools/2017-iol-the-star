The two men appeared in the high court in Joburg yesterday on charges of human trafficking and kidnapping. Frank Amaku, 26, and Ilo Promise Somadina, 25, were a shadow of their former selves, appearing scared and confused. Proceedings were delayed because the accused were having trouble paying their lawyer. One of their alleged victims, and the only one to have come forward, was a 21-year-old who was allegedly kept against her will at the premises of the accused in Randburg. Amaku and Somadina provided their victims with food, shelter and clothing while apparently operating a brothel. Between January and February last year, they met Alinah* in Upington, Northern Cape, and promised her a job and accommodation in Joburg if she agreed to go to Gauteng. The accused then organised and paid for Alinah to travel to Joburg. They did not give her a job as promised. Instead, they took photos of Alinah, posted them on the internet and allegedly advertised her services. During this period and several other occasions, the accused allegedly sexually exploited her for monetary reward. State advocate Lwazi Ngodwana said that he was happy with how the case was proceeding. “We have presented a strong case and we should be able to finish it soon,” he said. The trial was postponed to August 30. * Not her real name @Sabie_M

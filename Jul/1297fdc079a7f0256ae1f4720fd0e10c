The radio station and Phat Joe had mutually agreed not to renew his contract. “Phat Joe, who has been with ECR for a year, is leaving the station due to a variety of exciting new commitments outside KZN,” said East Coast in a statement. “Phat Joe has contributed substantially to East Coast Radio in his time as drive presenter, but his demanding schedule has put undue pressure on him.” Phat Joe has been no stranger to controversy during his stay in Durban and had angered striking students last year when he said those who burnt down buildings were “the worst people in the world”. The DJ said he was a victim of an anti-Phat Joe campaign and went to the UKZN to clear the air and clarify his statements with students. “I am more of a comedian, I’m not a journalist. So what I do is I use a lot of irony and comedy to deal with difficult issues. There is no doubt that there was a difficult issue that day” he had said. He also survived complaints, including from an angry parent over comments he made about “tattooing a baby”. A new host for the show will be announced shortly.

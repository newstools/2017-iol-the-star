A study by Victoria Milan says SA men spend only about 15 minutes pleasing their women per erotic encounter. The findings were based on a recent survey which assessed sexual performance of husbands from 20 countries based on reports from their unfaithful wives. The study showed South Africa ranked lowest in this regard, compared with countries such as the US, UK, Germany Spain and France. Women from Denmark emerged as possibly the most sexually fortunate, as they reported their husbands spent 44 minutes on average ensuring they reached climax during steamy sessions. The research was conducted by VictoriaMilan, an online dating network for married and attached people looking to cheat. The findings were based on observations of its 6117 active female members. VictoriaMilan founder and chief executive  Sigurd Vedal said in regard to the findings relating to South Africa, the quarter of an hour men took to satisfy their women could also be a good thing. “South Africans only need 15 minutes to bring their wives to orgasm, which is perfect if she likes to get the bedroom business out of the way quickly.” In the US, women enjoy a solid 41 minutes of sex per arousing encounter, as their diligent husbands strive to ensure they remain focused and faithful. The average Canadian husband spends 39 minutes making his wife reach a climax and the husbands in Sweden and Norway give their wives 33 minutes of pleasure each time they have sex. In the UK, Vedal said gents tried to treat their wives like royalty, spending at least 33 minutes per sexual encounter. He added: “If your (man) is from Belgium, it’s likely he can bring you an earth-shattering orgasm within 21 minutes of getting you into bed.” Vedal said that while it was challenging to keep a woman sexually satisfied, hard-working husbands would make the effort. It took “a real man”, he said, but “hero husbands will put as much time as it takes into keeping the lust levels licked.”

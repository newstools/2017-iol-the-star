Johannesburg - Eleven people were killed and 14 others injured when a bus and a truck collided on the Badplaas Road outside of Machadodorp in Mpumalanga around 7am on Tuesday morning. ER24's Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene to find the bus lying on its side while the truck was a short distance away in the middle of the road. Both vehicles were severely damaged. Meiring added that paramedics found several passengers lying inside the bus, trapped. Several others were trapped beneath the overturned bus while others were walking around the scene. “Paramedics discovered that a total of 11 patients had sustained fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for the patients and they were declared dead on the scene,” said Meiring. Among the 14 injured patients, two had sustained critical injuries while the remaining 12 sustained minor to moderate injuries.
Meiring added that one critically injured patient was airlifted to hospital. Joseph Mabuza, spokesperson for Community Safety in Mpumalanga said the officials were shocked on what happened as the road was not known for major accidents. “At the moment we don’t have details surrounding the accident; what we know is that it was a head on collision” said Mabuza.

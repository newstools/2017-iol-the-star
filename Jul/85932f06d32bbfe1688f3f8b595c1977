The body of Edward Blonski was found at the Zoo Lake on Tuesday. Relatives of the 32 year old confirmed it was the body of Blonski who went missing on the morning of June 24 in Parkwood. He was last seen jogging in Dorset Road in the suburb before his  disappearance. CCTV camera footage showed him wearing a blue T-shirt and white knee-length cargo shorts, with no shoes. Posters and pictures of him were plastered around Joburg. Blonski’s family posted his picture on every social media outlet, as well as information on his disappearance. The Pink Ladies were part of the search as well as the People Search and Rescue Unit, which reported on Saturday he was last seen on foot walking in the area of Zoo Lake. Parkview Police Station said his body was found floating in the lake by members of the public. The cause of death had not been confirmed and police were awaiting post-mortem results. “We cannot confirm the cause of death because an autopsy is still to be done on the body,” police said. Blonski’s cousin Jacqueline Wijtenburg said the search had been relentless. ”Although a sad conclusion, his body has helped us find closure. We have learnt of his tragic death and are heartbroken.” She thanked people who took their time to share his picture on social media and spread the word about his disappearance, as well as everyone who had supported her family. “Many people go missing and never get found.” Wijtenburg described her cousin as a deep thinker and a gentle soul. “Edward was a gentle, funny soul that was full of creativity. We will miss him,” she said. Blonski, who was one of five siblings, was a candidate architectural technologist. An inquest case was opened for investigation.

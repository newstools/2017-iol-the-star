Johannesburg - An argument over a room in an abandoned building led to the death of seven people  in the Johannesburg CBD. Seven others were rushed to hospital with serious injuries. The fire is believed to have started at 9am and allegations are that it all began when two people were arguing over a room and one of them then started the fire in anger. There was chaos as the fire spread and some people rushed out of the burning structure. Others used their bedding as a makeshift rope to escape the deadly flames. Some rushed on the top of the building and fire fighters had to use an extended ladder to save them and bring them down to safety. One person died while trying to escape the deadly fire. The abandoned building, was allegedly home to drug users and sex workers and was a problem for the neighboring businesses. Johannesburg Emergency Services spokesperson Nana Radebe said the cause of the fire was still now known.    She also said that the victims of the tragedy had also not been identified and the process of identification could only take place after the preliminary investigation.    Radebe also said over 40 people had been rescued from the building. The DA has since sent its heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and loved ones of those who perished.

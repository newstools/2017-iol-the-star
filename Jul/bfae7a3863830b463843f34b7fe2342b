As the city continues to evolve into a hub for all things lifestyle, new venue Joziburg at No. 1 Eloff is adding to the mix with a selection of food, exhibitions and rooftop parties. From next week, people will be able to call the downtown yellow and blue block the place to be. The venue is also a space for street trader style stores - Bag Alley where entrepreneurs are given a platform to understand the retail market. There are also office spaces to let. Art and music lovers will be in for a cultural explosion when The Kolektiv Pop Up Gallery starts hosting talks and the first of the Film Noire screenings start to show. Picture: Callie de Wet.  People can look forward to Sifiso Khanyile’s June 16 documentary Uprize as the first screening. Saturdays are always filled with events and Joziburg will be no different, hosting a monthly day rooftop event The Feel Good Sessions. Next Saturday will see Melo B Jones perform alongside DJs 1D, Bubbles the DJ, Doda and more. On July 30, The Bubblegum Club will host a weekly New Sound Night for art and music lovers where upcoming artists will showcase their music. There’s also another venue in the works that promises to bring back the nostalgia of yesteryear and celebrate artists that changed the face of music in South Africa. The gallery will see creatives from the fashion, art and design space collaborate and host exhibitions. Every last Thursday of the month, a new collaboration will be hosted.

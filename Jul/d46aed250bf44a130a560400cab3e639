In a statement issued by the Presidency after his return from the summit in Hamburg, Zuma said the meeting had resulted in positive outcomes to a large degree as G20 leaders discussed and agreed on various developmental issues that would benefit the African continent. “Despite disagreements on certain issues, the summit managed to discuss and agree on various developmental matters that would be of advantage to South Africa and the African continent, including the launch of the G20 Africa partnership. This programme was launched in recognition of the opportunities and challenges on the African continent as well as the goals of the United Nations Social Development Agenda 2030,” he said. “It was agreed that this initiative would be based on equal partnerships and will be in line with the African Union Agenda 2063. The partnership will further serve our national interest as it will generate sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development, contribute to create decent employment and economic advancement for women and youth, as well as alleviate poverty and inequality.” Among other issues discussed during the summit were sustainable development, climate and energy. Despite differences on climate and energy matters, including the decision of the US to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the majority of leaders remained committed to the agreement as it represented the best opportunities to address the threats posed by climate change. The leaders reaffirmed their strong commitment to the Paris Agreement and agreed on full implementation of the agreement and also agreed to the G20 Hamburg Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth, Zuma said. - ANA

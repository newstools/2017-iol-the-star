This follows the murder at the well-known Sakhumzi Restaurant earlier this year, where the 60-year old manager was gunned down shortly after the restaurant closed for the night. The restaurant had shut for the evening and staff were busy cashing up when two men came to the entrance of the restaurant. The manager was shot after he refused to let them in. He
died on the scene and the men fled. At the time, Mashaba visited the area and vowed to install a CCTV camera system in the famous street to enhance the safety of business owners, the public and tourists visiting this popular area. Vilakazi Street is the only one in the world that boasts the homes of two Nobel Peace Prize laureates - Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu - and is one of South Africa’s major tourist attractions. It is also home to a number of eateries and businesses. “The businesses along Vilakazi Street are important to the economy of not only Orlando West and Soweto, but also for Joburg as a whole, and the CCTV camera system will ensure that security in the area is enhanced in an effort to protect both the business owners, as well as visitors,” said the mayor. @annacox

Passengers say they are unable to load money on to their smart cards at all stations for travel. However, passengers can still travel on the Rea Vaya if they have funds on their cards. If they don’t have funds, they can still purchase single trips, which are much more expensive. Passengers with Absa cards can load funds at Absa cash-accepting ATMs and can also purchase single trip cards to travel. According to Rea Vaya spokesperson Benny Makgoga, the matter is being attended to on an urgent basis. “We hope to have the loading capacity up and running as soon as possible. “We will continue to provide regular feedback to passengers through the media and our internal communication channels such as the SMS Line, Facebook and Twitter. The city apologises for the inconvenience caused,” he added.

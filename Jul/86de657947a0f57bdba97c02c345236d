The birthday girl, who turned 30 on June 25, held a lavish party at the weekend which is said to have cost R500000. Her 200 guests - including Nomzamo Mbatha, T-bo Touch, Khanyi Dhlomo, Maps Maponyane and Basetsana Khumalo - went home with gifts, including her book. There were pretty ballerinas and bottomless champagne at the pink-themed celebration, held at Summer Place in Hyde Park, Joburg. The party was the culmination of celebrations that included a New York trip with her boyfriend, rapper AKA. Her dress, dripping in pink with a lot of ruffles in the skirt, was created by designer Gert-Johan Coetzee. At least one person thought it was a hit. @Th e R e a *  _ Th a *  e *  o tweeted: “Bonang’s dress is everything ;....Yasss Queeeeeeen!!!” The ballerinas opened the floor with a performance and then led the way for Bonang when she entered the hall dancing to AKA’s The World Is Yours. But people were hating on Bonang for holding her party the same day as Kairo’s birthday - her bae’s two-year-old daughter with DJ Zinhle - and Minnie Dlamini’s wedding with beau Quinton Jones. Some thought it was a case of Bonang trying to show up her celeb rival since her birthday was almost two weeks ago, while others thought she was being petty and competitive by vying for AKA’s attention with his daughter. @TJRMakhetha tweeted: “Competing with Minnie is one thing. Competing with Kairo though? A child? Bonang needs help” While AKA was with his daughter on her birthday and posted a cute video of her having cake, one asked why Bonang was apparently competing with a child. - Staff Reporter

The Tshwane region launched its sticker campaign with provincial public relations officer Midday Mali saying they were responding to the Department of Community Safety’s complaint that their vehicles were unidentifiable. “The purpose of this launch is so that our vehicles are easily identified for the safety of our commuters and operators on the road. We want our commuters to easily identify which vehicles operate as taxis and which do not.” Mali said the launch was done primarily for the safety of commuters and taxi operators. “Any taxi that causes uneasiness for commuters is regarded as ours, which it is not always the case. So the stickers would make it easy to know which Quantums belong to our organisation and which don’t,” he said. Yesterday’s sticker launch was the start of the provincial initiative to brand Santaco’s taxis; other regions are set to launch stickers soon. Each taxi will bear two stickers, one at the back and the other at the front. Mali said the one at the back was so that anyone driving behind their vehicle would know that the taxi belonged to Santaco. “We want to be visible and to bring change in the industry. We want other people to let us know how we can improve our services or driving because we will now be recognisable,” he said. After the official launch yesterday, representatives from the organisation went to the Bloed Street mall, Marabastad and Bosman stations to put stickers on all taxis in their organisation.

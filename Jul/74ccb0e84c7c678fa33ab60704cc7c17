They included Premier David Makhura and SACP general secretary  Blade Nzimande, who led his party’s delegation. Nzimande said Mamoepa’s passing was a huge loss to the movement. “As much as this is a loss for the family, it is also a huge loss to us (SACP), as a movement. “You just don’t go to a shelf and buy a communicator like Ronnie, who served the movement and government with absolute distinction.” Nzimande said, as much as this was a sad time and people were mourning, the prolific spokesperson had lived an incredible life. “We must use this time to celebrate Ronnie’s life 56 is relatively young. He went to prison at a very young age and he also made a huge impact in the government and the Department of Communications.” Nzimande said the communications legend was an example to the youth of today, professionals and public servants on how to carry themselves in service to their country. He hoped Mamoepa’s legacy would be honoured. “These young communicators have learnt something from him, because some of them passed through his hands. His example is worth following by all government spokespeople.” The ANC’s Gauteng chairperson, Paul Mashatile, also paid tribute to Mamoepa, and called for the prolific spokesperson’s life to be celebrated. “Ronnie was deeply committed to his work and we want to give him a proper send-off for the good work he has done for the movement.” Mashatile said Mamoepa was not only reliable to the government but also to the media, as he was always available whenever they needed his input for information. Mamoepa died on Saturday night in a Pretoria hospital from complications from a stroke. At the time of his death, he was Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson.

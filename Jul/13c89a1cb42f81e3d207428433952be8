Although no one was injured, an undisclosed amount of goods was stolen from a jewellery store at the premises in Aspen Hills on Sunday. Mall of the South manager Hester Smith told The Star that an armed group entered NWJ Fine Jewellery at 10.22am. They made off with "an undisclosed amount of goods", and fired a shot as they left. Smith said mall security immediately responded when the store alerted them of the incident. But the group was already on their way out of the mall with the stolen goods. Luckily no one was injured and the mall resumed trading shortly afterwards. “The safety and security of tenants and shoppers is of utmost importance to centre management,” Smith added. Provincial police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masonda confirmed the robbery and said that it was under investigation. The Star has reported on several robberies and criminal activities at Mall of the South since it opened in September 2015. In May last year, armed men stormed into the Vodacom 4U store and made off with goods valued at around R600000. Just a week before that, a man fired a warning shot into the air at the premises after a group of robbers tried to steal his vehicle. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said at the time that the victim had parked his Toyota Tazz on the upper level of the mall. When he returned he found a man trying to start it. He fought with the suspect as he tried to remove him from his vehicle. “There was another green Toyota Tazz parked next to his vehicle, and three men climbed out of it and started assaulting the complainant. Two men were arrested at the time." Also in May 2016, three staff from Steers and Debonairs were robbed at gunpoint. @Karishma_Dipa The Star  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter

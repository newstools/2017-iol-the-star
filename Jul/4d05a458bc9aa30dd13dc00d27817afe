It has been a year since the twins were arrested on suspicion of plotting terror attacks in South Africa. The twins, who have been behind bars since their arrest in July 2016, have been charged with conspiracy and incitement to commit the crime of terrorism and conspiring and attempting to commit acts associated with terrorist activities. Prosecutor Adele Barnard told the court yesterday that 212 pages of statements previously requested by the defence had been handed to them. However, Barnard said that morning she received an email from the defence notifying her that they could not open the digital copies. The State said it was willing to print the said documents, but it would require finance. Advocate Anneline van den Heever, for the defence, said special software was needed to download certain parts of the document and that the state had to apply for finance to get hard copies printed as soon as possible as the documents would be needed when the case goes to trial. Itâ€™s alleged that in August 2015, one of the twins, Tony-Lee, participated in a series of chats with Abu Fidaa, an Islamic State network, and others.
The matter was postponed to Tuesday.

According to residents, Red Ants security guards arrived at their building in the early hours of yesterday, hurling insults while pointing firearms and instructing them to vacate the premises without being warned. The Fattis Mansion residents’ belongings were strewn along Harrison Street when our news team arrived. Thobisa Mgibantaka, who claims to have been assaulted while carrying her child, said: “I was standing by the steps with my baby on my back and I had my bags with me. “One of the Red Ants came and tried to push me. I asked him to make room for me as I wanted to exit the building, but he took my ID book, money and cellphone.” Some residents stood watching as their belongings were thrown out of the building. They claimed to have been surprised by the eviction and did not have alternative accommodation. Ndumiso Nojojo, who has been living in the building since 2010, said he was woken by neighbours who told him of the eviction. “These people just pitched up at about 8am, acting aggressively. They didn’t even give us a chance to see the court order or pack up our things. It’s not the first time. “We were evicted in 2015 and able to come back after the court ruled the eviction illegal.”

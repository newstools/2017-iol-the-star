Johannesburg - Diepsloot residents are up in arms and have blocked off major routes around their area over the lack of electricity in the informal settlement. 
The N14 and the R511 (William Nicol Drive) were barricaded with rocks, burning tyres and rubble in the protest that started earlier on Monday morning as police and protesting residents clashed. 
Residents said they took up the matter with the municipality on numerous occasions but have not been listened to. 
One of the residents in Extension 1, who asked not to be named, said they felt aggravated by the apathy shown towards them. 
"How do they expect us to live without electricity. We don't have water nor do we have electricity here since 1995. It's as if they want us to do this every time we try to engage them about this problem," he said. 
Most of the roads within the township have been blocked off, while commuters have been left stranded with no alternative transport or routes. 
"We don't know what happened, we just heard vuvuzelas being blown in the early hours of this morning and people saying we need to go out and protest but some of us opted not to," said Mpho Lekalakala. 
The Johannesburg Metro Police Department advised motorists to avoid N14 and R511 and seek alternative routes such as the N1 and R55. The Star

According to him, the festival will celebrate the life of the minister and thank him for his contribution as a musician. “We won’t be like other organisers who take artists from Gauteng and other provinces to come and perform here in Limpopo, but we will allow 98% of our local artists to showcase their talents,” said Chauke. The annual festival was launched and set to take place two years ago, but due to logistical issues, it was postponed to this year. Matimba Chabane, the son of the late minister, has supported the idea of honouring his father. “As a family we support this initiative as my father loved music,” he said. Among the artists set to perform is the Zimbabwean group The Movers, who the minister used to sing for, crowd-puller Xitsonga music maestro Benny Mayengani, and many more. Chabane’s love for music dates back to when he broke his teeth while playing the harmonica when he was serving a 10-year sentence on Robben Island. In 2010, he received a Munghana Lonene FM lifetime achievement award, and during the same year, he received another award from the South African Music Rights Organisation. Chabane died in 2015 in a horrific car accident on the N1 along with his two bodyguards.

This is according to Gauteng member of the executive committee (MEC) for co-operative governance and traditional affairs and human settlements, Paul Mashatile. The Thokoza Hostel has been considered one of the most dangerous places in the province since the regular clashes between the ANC and IFP during the 1980s and 1990s. Little has changed in the state of the hostels which, in fact, have become worse, despite numerous promises by the province to renovate them and turn them into family units. After holding a meeting with the hostel’s izinduna and its steering committee, Mashatile said improvements would start immediately. The meeting follows meetings that were held by Ekurhuleni’s member of the mayoral committee of human settlements, Lesiba Mpya, and Gauteng Department of Human Settlements officials with the hostel residents. In the well-attended meeting, Mashatile, chairperson of portfolio committee of human settlements Putus Tseki, and the hostel leadership discussed renovations, improvements and future plans for the family units. Mashatile said renovations would start without delay. The MEC said the future plans for the family units would be discussed with the steering committee of the hostel to ensure residents had an input. Mashatile added that the department would also send officials to register residents who stay in the hostel in the housing database. He said residents who had applied in 1996 would be prioritised in projects in Ekurhuleni. @annacox

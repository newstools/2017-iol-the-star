After poring over photos, asking hundreds of experts and taking precise measurements, it turns out that ideal derrières all have one thing in common: a magic number corresponding to the ratio between the waist and the hips. The researchers found the most admired figure, expressed as a ratio of 0.7, was the same as the vital statistics of stars from the golden age of cinema, including Sophia Loren, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. A number of modern celebrities also come close to this magic number. British actress and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has a 6.2.5cm waist and 88.9cm hips, boasts a ratio of 0.71, calculated by dividing the circumferences of the waist by the hip. US singer Beyoncé is just a fraction off the ideal at 0.65, with a 66.04cm waist and 101.6cm hips. Scientists from Erasmus University in the Netherlands showed 583 plastic surgeons and 450 members of the public in 40 countries images of a 27-year-old model that were digitally altered to create a range of body shapes. Overall, the researchers said 39%, the biggest group, found the 0.7 waist to hip ratio was their ideal. The authors said: "Of all body parts, across many cultures and time, the buttocks have endured as a key body element of female beauty." Writing in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, they added: "There seems to exist a global consensus regarding the ideal waist to hip ratio." Views varied between nations, with surgeons in Latin America preferring the largest buttocks, followed by those in Asia, North America and Europe. Having a slimmer waist than hips is not just a measure of beauty, but doctors say it may be a better indicator of health than body mass index, which is your weight divided by height squared. Some women go to great lengths to achieve the perfect behind, with buttock augmentation surgery becoming increasingly popular. The authors said the number of operations had increased by more than 20% between 2014 and 2015. - Daily Mail

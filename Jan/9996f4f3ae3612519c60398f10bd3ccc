Cape Town - The ANC has been accused by opposition parties of getting cold feet at the 11th hour by refusing to finalise recommendations on the probe into the SABC.The ad hoc committee was on Thursday supposed to finalise discussions on the recommendations into the draft report when the ANC changed its position.The DA, EFF, IFP and National Freedom Party accused the ANC of reneging on its earlier position to conclude the recommendations.The ANC proposed to the committee it must finalise the draft report without recommendations, and deal with them at a later stage.But this proposal was rejected outright by opposition parties, who said the ruling party was now reneging on its position.DA MP Phumzile van Damme said the ANC was getting cold feet. Why are we getting cold feet now. I don t support the position that we do half our work, and suddenly we get cold feet. We cannot send the report without recommendations, said Van Damme.She said this was standard practice all over on reports and even the public protector sent out her draft report with recommendations.Steve Swart, of the ACDP, also said in the draft report they would emphasise that the recommendations weren't final and may be subject to amendments.Fana Mokoena, of the EFF, also warned that the entire process would be null and void if the draft report went out to affected parties without recommendations. We stand to self-sabotage if we stop such a glorious process so far. At the last minute to renege and hold back on recommendations is one thing that will sabotage this committee, he said.Makhosi Khoza, of the ANC, said they were not getting cold feet. The ANC will be decisive in the draft report and action that needs to be taken.&quot; We cannot compare this ad hoc committee to the public protector. Our recommendations are recommendations to Parliament and it will take a decision on those, she said.ANC MP Hlomane Chauke said there was still a lot of work to do. The ANC was committed to a clean and transparent process.Political Bureau

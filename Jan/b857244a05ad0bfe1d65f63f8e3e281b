Johannesburg A shocking video has emerged of a shoot-out between would-be robbers and their intended victim in Bedfordview at the weekend. Details contained in the video suggest that the incident happened about 1:40pm on Sunday. The minute-and-a-half long video, posted on social media, shows a silver Mercedes-Benz pull up to a property driveway. The driver of the car stops briefly and chats to what appears to be a guard. Seconds after stopping, a blue VW Golf drives past reducing speed before stopping and then reversing and driving up the driveway. A man wearing a cap comes out of the the left rear passenger seat. The guard appears to attempt to make conversation with the driver but is taken aback when the passenger pulls out and cocks a gun. As the guard puts his hands up and the gunman points him to the floor, the VW Golf reverses again. In one frame, the driver of the Mercedes-Benz, apparently already aware of the unfolding events, jumps out of the car holding a handgun and starts firing shots towards the closing gate. The would-be robber&nbsp; then flees the scene. He disappears from the frame but it is unclear if got back into the car him and his accomplices came in or runs down the street.&nbsp; A taxi is driving down the street when the target, still holding his gun, peeps out his gate. Police spokesperson Captain Andre de Jager said he was not aware of the incident but said police would investigate.More details to follow. sihle.manda@inl.co.za The Star

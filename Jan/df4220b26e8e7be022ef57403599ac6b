Johannesburg As of today, Advocate Gerrie Nel is no longer in the employ of the National Prosecuting Authority after handing in a 24 hour notice on Monday.He worked for them for 35 years.Spokesperson for the NPA Luvuyo Mfaku confirmed that Nel handed in his immediate resignation yesterday to the Director of Public Prosecutor. Gerrie Nel handed in his 24-hour resignation and stated that he wishes to pursue other things. We wish him well on his future endeavors. He has left with immediate effect, he said. Nel resigns at the time that he was busy with a murder case of flying squad member Edward Kennedy Fox who is accused of murdering his wife as she slept at their Vereeniging home three years ago. Fox then blamed the murder on intruders.Mfaku said they always anticipate that prosecutors will leave hence they always pair them in cases so that if anything was to happen, the other prosecutor takes over. He said they do that for purposes of continuity and that the Fox case would continue as planned and that Nel's unexpected and sudden resignation will not halt it. &quot;We have great prosecutors,&quot; he said.Describing Nel as a &quot;consummate professional&quot;, Mfaku said they did not know why he left except that he was to pursue other interests.&quot;We don't interrogate people as to why they leave; it's a private matter. He believed in the NPA and was always professional, hardworking and dedicated. He mentored a lot of people who are now in senior management in the NPA; he really imparted his skills. He made a big impact in the NPA and will be missed by his colleagues. We wish him all the best,&quot; Mfaku said.Nel, nicknamed bulldog for his aggressive interrogation style in court, prosecuted among others Oscar Pistorius and former police commissioner the late Jackie Selebi.Nel was given an award a few years ago for his successful prosecution of Selebi. @heidigiokosThe Star

Johannesburg Parties have begun looking for individuals with broader skills before submitting the names of people to be nominated to serve on the interim board of the SABC.Parliament is expected to start a process next week that will culminate in the nomination of five people to serve on the interim board to be appointed by President Jacob Zuma.An interim board consists of five non-executive board members as well as the chief executive, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.Zuma last month stated that he would wait for the National Assembly to conclude its inquiry into the public broadcaster and then be guided by recommendations on the future of the board.This was after the last non-executive board member, Professor Mbulaheni Maguvhe, resigned after his failed bid to interdict the parliamentary inquiry probing the board s fitness to hold office.The SABC is without non-executive board members and has only acting executives.With the ad hoc committee into affairs of the SABC compiling its report, parties are considering the calibre of people to serve on the committee, guided by the Broadcasting Act.Moloto Mothapo, spokesperson for the ANC chief whip's office, said they wanted capable men and women with experience in corporate governance, legal issues and a whole range of competencies who would steer the ship at the SABC.Mothapo also said the skills and experience of the nominees, in line with requirements contained in the Broadcasting Act, should enable them to immediately address the issues arising from the ad hoc committee until a fully fledged board was in place.DA spokesperson Phumzile van Damme said they were consulting countrywide on the calibre of people meeting the requirements of the act.She said they would not nominate people affiliated to any political party.Van Damme said nominees with expertise in broadcasting, media and journalism would get their backing.The EFF last week called on members of the public to supply it with names of seasoned individuals who were available to serve on the interim board.Party spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi called on experienced individuals to avail themselves to serve the country and restore public trust in the SABC. If capable men and women do not avail themselves, then we will all be reduced to the inevitable result of being led by mediocre and weak individuals prone to manipulation by dominant factions of the ruling party to the detriment of the public institutions, he said.On Monday, communications portfolio committee chair Humphrey Maxegwana said SABC boards had in the past boasted of highly qualified people like lawyers, doctors and advocates. You need such skills and qualifications so that people are not found wanting, he said.He, however, said qualified people could still be corrupt and misled.Maxegwana said they wanted people who would be faithful to the public and help bring stability to the SABC. If you have a disgruntled workforce, you create problems in a company, so you need a board to look at those things. Maxegwana also said that as soon they returned to Parliament next week, they would outline the process of nominations for the interim board.This would be followed by obtaining names of nominees from various parties. We must submit five names to serve on the interim board to the National Assembly. The National Assembly will then take them to the president, he said.The Star

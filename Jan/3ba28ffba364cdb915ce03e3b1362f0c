Johannesburg During a routine stop-and-search operation by Joburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers, four armed robbers were arrested just before 2pm on Sunday near Doornfontein. City of Joburg member of the mayoral committee for public safety, Michael Sun said that when JMPD officers stopped the white Ford vehicle, the four male occupants attempted to bribe their way out of the search. The JMPD officers rejected the bribe and during the search discovered two bags containing two illegal firearms, ammunition, laptop computers, cell-phones and other electrical accessories. On further investigation, it was discovered that the suspects had earlier in the day robbed a well-known electronic chain store in the Heidelberg area, said Sun. He commended the JMPD officers for their quick reactions and for standing firm against corruption . It is because of their integrity and professionalism that there are now four less armed and dangerous criminals within our city, he said. The suspects were later taken to Jeppe Police Station where they were charged for armed robbery, as well as for possession of stolen goods, illegal firearm and ammunition. @annacoxanna.cox@inl.co.zaThe Star

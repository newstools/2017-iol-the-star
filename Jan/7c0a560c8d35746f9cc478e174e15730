Johannessburg The murder case against Mark Zinde was on Tuesday rolled over in the Brits Regional Court in North West because his attorney wasn't available. The 23-year-old accused, who has undergone psychiatric evaluation and treatment, is accused of killing his mother, Hope Zinde, and assaulting his father, Dr Lebohang Mohale Manoto, while out on R10 000 bail.His mother was a former SABC board member and journalist. At the time of her death she was general manager of corporate affairs at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa.State prosecutor advocate Hanna Conradie told the court that another reason why the murder case was postponed was because there were problems transporting the accused from Vereeniging. Zinde arrived in court after noon.Conradie said that despite receiving a copy of the indictment, a date was yet to be set for Zinde s matter to be referred to the high court in Pretoria. He allegedly killed his mother in June last year at her home in Pecanwood estate outside Brits and attacked his father with a glass a few months later, on November 6. The accused s bail for the murder case has since been revoked, after he was arrested for assaulting his father while on bail for his mother s murder.Zinde was yesterday expected to hear whether he would be referred back to Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital in Pretoria, and to hear when his case would be heard in the high court. Zinde s attorney, Francois Joubert, previously told the court he had received a report from a doctor indicating that the accused needed more assessments. The hospital had earlier found him fit to stand trial.The assault case is being heard in the Vereeniging Magistrate s Court and the assault case in Brits.tankiso.makhetha@inl.co.zaThe Star

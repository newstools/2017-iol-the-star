Johannesburg A financial shortfall has been given by the Gauteng Department of Education as the reason behind the delay in payment to teachers for the marking of exam scripts. Disgruntled teachers have complained to the DA that some of them were not paid and others have only received a quarter of the money owing to them.DA provincial Education spokesperson Khume Ramulifho said despite the fact that R1.3 billion was approved by the legislature to fund examination and educational-related services in the 2016/17 financial year, not all teachers had been paid. It is unacceptable the Gauteng Department of Education cannot maintain prudent financial management to ensure it pays for services rendered to it. The DA urges the MEC to intervene to avoid planned protest action on Friday as it will disrupt learning and teaching, said Ramulifho. Teachers would need to wait until the end of March for payment, said acting spokesperson for the department, Oupa Bodibe. Partial payment has been made to all markers. The department is awaiting approval for additional funds and will pay the balance before the end of March. The department wholeheartedly apologises for this, said Bodibe.Some teachers have told The Star they were planning to march to the department on Friday if the payments were not made by then. Let us swell the streets of Joburg on Friday to register our anger and feeling of betrayal against this silly and dirty conduct of the employer. We call upon all our unions to support us by taking a lead in this intended mass action, said a teacher.The Star

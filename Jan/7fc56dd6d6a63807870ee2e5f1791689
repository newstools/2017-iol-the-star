Johannesburg - Inspired by his grandfather who suffered from dementia, Norman Mulla, a Mpumalanga pupil, hopes his good grades will propel him towards finding a cure for the illness. Norman was one of 23 pupils who were celebrated on Wednesday during a breakfast with the Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga. I wanted to study medicine from a young age because my grandfather had dementia.&quot;&quot;I realised that it s not only the patient who suffers but also family members and friends who suffer, the matriculant said. He said that by helping people who struggled with dementia he was hoping to make a difference in the lives of those who support and care for them. To cure one patient will eventually help so many other lives, and to be in a position that takes me one step closer to that dream is a true privilege, he said. The Ho&euml;rskool Rob Ferreira pupil said he was humbled to be among the top achievers. Norman is one of the top three pupils in the country in science and math. I m really ecstatic. It s really shocking that I have made it so far. I'm really glad, and feel privileged and honoured to be here today, Norman said. The 18-year-old, who pursued a science stream, said before the results were announced that he was expecting to attain distinctions for the seven subjects he studied. I m expecting distinctions for all seven but we ll see what the results look like when they come out. Norman said he intended pursuing a degree in medicine at Wits University. Despite the challenges he has encountered, the matriculant said he was able to persevere through all of them. His father, Shamshuddin Mulla explained that one of the challenges he experienced was keeping Norman motivated. We always stood by him as far as support is concerned. &quot;We monitored all his activities at school and at home and encouraged him to do things that would be beneficial for him while discouraging him from doing things that wouldn t pay off, he said.

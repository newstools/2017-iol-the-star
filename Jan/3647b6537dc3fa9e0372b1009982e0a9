Johannesburg Four people were arrested after two men were shot outside a Joburg pizza outlet early on Monday morning, police said. One of the shot men was confirmed dead at the scene while the other was taken to&nbsp; C harlotte Maxeke Hospital in a serious condition. Police spokesperson Constable David Mothapo said that four people have been &nbsp;charged with murder and attempted murder and will appear in court soon. Mothapo explained that at around 3am this morning, the pair were at a pizza shop in Sandton when they were approached by an unknown man and woman. He said that an argument then ensued between the two groups which eventually escalated into a physical altercation. One of the men then pulled out a firearm and shot at both victims. The pair then fled the scene in a vehicle with two others also inside. But in a twist, the group drove to the Alexandra police station where they attempted to open a case of assault against the victims that one of them shot at. It was then when officers realised that the group, including two men and two women, were the ones behind the Sandton pizza store shooting. Police then picked up that the suspects committed a crime and they were arrested at the police station, said Mothapo. He said that the motive was still unknown.&nbsp; The matter is still under investigation. [email&#160;protected] The Star

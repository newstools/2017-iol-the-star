Johannesburg - Joburg police are still searching for the parents or guardians of a 3-or-4-year-old boy who was found dead in Greymont Park on December 29 last year.Meanwhile, investigators have discovered the young boy may have been poisoned. The body was discovered at around 9am on December 29 by members of the community who live around the park, together with workers employed by Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo (JCPZ). Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that a case of murder had been opened at the Sophiatown Police Station, where a preliminary post-mortem report was compiled. The boy has not yet been identified. Also, the post-mortem indicates that the boy might have been poisoned.&quot;&quot;We cannot say which type of poison was used to kill the boy as this would negatively impact the investigation. We also cannot indicate what race the boy is. No signs of physical abuse have been detected, he said.Makhubele said the boy was found wearing a grey top, long black trousers and black sneakers. We are appealing to anyone with information to come forward because we don't know who this boy is, where he was coming from, or who dumped him there. So it will be very helpful if someone comes forward. &quot;We haven t received any reports of missing boys of that age, Makhubele said.He said a motive for the poisoning has yet to be established.Spokesperson for JCPZ, Jenny Moodley, expressed sadness at the death of the boy, adding that her department had also enlisted the help of residents who lived around the park to assist them in identifying the boy or his parents. On behalf of the team at JCPZ we are appealing to the parents of this toddler to come forward. Somewhere, somebody is missing a beautiful child. Let's help ensure that he can rest in peace, she said. @khayakoko88The Star

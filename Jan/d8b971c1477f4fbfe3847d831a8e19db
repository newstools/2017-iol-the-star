Johannesburg A small team comprising ANC stalwarts and the party's top leadership has been tasked to look at the logistics pertaining to the national consultative conference to be held later this year.The conference is expected to address the challenging facing the organisation, and following a meeting between the party s officials including President Jacob Zuma, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and treasurer Zweli Mkhize at the party s Luthuli House headquarters in Joburg on Tuesday, it was agreed that a small team look into the modalities of the conference. The team, representing both groups, would look into the timing of the conference, that is, the date it should be held; the content and structure of the conference; and ensure all relevant party structures were adequately represented to ensure coverage of all issues that can be identified as causal to the challenges currently being faced by the organisation . The party agreed to the conference late last year following repeated requests by the stalwarts who were concerned about the direction the 105-year old former liberation movement was taking. The stalwarts said Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa didn t attend the meeting as he led the South African delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The parties to the meeting underlined the understanding that the NCC should not just be a single event but as part of a process that should go beyond both the policy and elective conferences of the party, the stalwarts said in a statement. @luyolomkentane The Star

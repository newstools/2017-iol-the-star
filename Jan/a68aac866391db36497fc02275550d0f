Johannesburg - During a routine stop-and-search operation by Joburg metro police department officers, four alleged armed robbers were arrested near Doornfontein just before 2pm on Sunday.Michael Sun, the member of the mayoral committee for public safety, said that when the officers stopped the white Ford, the four male occupants tried to bribe their way out of the search. The officers rejected the bribe, and during the search, they discovered two bags containing two illegal firearms, ammunition, laptop computers, cellphones and other electrical accessories. It was discovered that earlier in the day the suspects had allegedly robbed a well-known electronic chain store in the Heidelberg area. Sun commended the officers for their quick reactions and for &quot;standing firm against corruption&quot;. It is because of their integrity and professionalism that there are now four fewer armed and dangerous criminals within our city, he said.The suspects were taken to Jeppe police station, where they were charged with armed robbery, as well as for possession of stolen goods, illegal firearm and ammunition.&nbsp; anna.cox@inl.co.zaThe Star

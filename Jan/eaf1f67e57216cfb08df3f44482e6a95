Cape Town The SACP has reiterated its call for a clear policy on the succession debate as a means of eliminating factions within the ANC.Benson Nqentsu, an SACP district secretary, was speaking at the ruling party s 105th birthday celebration for the Dullah Omar Region held in Kraaifontein. To loud cheers from the crowd, Nqentsu said that, following the party s dismal performance in the municipal elections last year, it was time that the ANC and its alliance partners conducted some introspection.Campaigns like CR17 (Cyril Ramaphosa 2017), NDZ (Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma) and BM (Baleka Mbete) were the very definition of factions which are the main cause of problems for the movement.Social media has been abuzz with posters and items of clothing with the words BM17 posted as a means to campaign for the upcoming national conference.Labelling party members as having being bought whenever one raises constructive criticism was also killing morale, he said. As the SACP we say we need to choose whether to unite the movement or move towards the same destructive path we are on.&quot; But whenever you critique the ANC, some accuse you of being a puppet of white monopoly capital when they are the ones dining with big business.&quot;&quot;For the ANC to unite it must dissolve the premier league, CR17, MB17 and NDZ factions.&quot;Political Bureau

Johannesburg The Department of Water and Sanitation has called on South Africans to continue using water sparingly.A media tour of the Vaal Dam in Deneysville on Wednesday aimed to explain how rainfall over the past few months has impacted the Vaal River system since November.Deputy director-general of emergency projects Trevor Balzer explained that the system consists of 14 dams, with the Vaal Dam being just one. Before we can consider lifting restrictions, we need the level of the Vaal River system to be at 70 percent or above, he said. Balzer emphasised that the Vaal Dam was not the only indicator when looking at water supply levels for Gauteng.Although it had picked up a significant amount of water over the past week, Gauteng and the country in its entirety were not out of the woods. The national water level was at 48.8 percent full last week and it s gone up to 50.7 percent this week. It s not enough, Balzer said. The rain that falls in southern parts of Joburg, Gauteng and the Wilge River area in the Free State is what supplies the Vaal.&quot;The department's Sputnik Ratau added: &quot;We need significantly above-normal rainfall. We have to remember that with high temperatures there is also a high evaporation rate. The more rain we get, the better. We need to take the message the municipalities say seriously.&quot; @Lanc_02The Star

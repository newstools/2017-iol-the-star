Johannesburg A twist in the saga over alleged improprieties committed by acting national police commissioner General Khomotso Phahlane was expected on Thursday when the DA reveals what it says is credible evidence of corruption by him. Phahlane is being investigated by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) for corrupt practices allegedly committed as head of the police s forensics unit.His house was searched by Ipid last week, and it will also be investigating alleged corruption in his acquisition of some of his luxury vehicles.DA spokesperson Darren Brookbanks said their MP Zakhele Mbhele would be presenting new evidence which is contained in a report submitted to the DA . On whether the report and new evidence were credible, Brookbanks asserted that the DA were confident. Meanwhile, Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini said it will not comment as that might prejudice the investigation.Asked whether Ipid sets time limits on investigations, Dlamini added: In terms of Ipid regulations, typically investigations should be completed within three months, but there is provision for further extensions for as long as necessary. He said it was Ipid's duty to make recommendations to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) if a matter is criminal in nature, and to the police if it is a police disciplinary issue. It is then up to the NPA to institute prosecutions in the courts, and the SAPS to institute disciplinary action.&quot;The Star

Johannesburg - Rhythm City actor Jamie Bartlett is said to be &quot;coping after being the victim of a harrowing hijacking and robbery ordeal in Brixton, Joburg, on Friday night. A source close to the SA s Got Talent judge said it hadn't been an easy few days for him, but that Bartlett was doing okay. It has been a traumatic experience for him and it hasn't been easy, but he's coping. He's dealing with it in the best way he can, the source said.Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said the incident happened while Bartlett was waiting at a red traffic light. The men pointed a gun at him and got into his Mercedes-Benz vehicle, where they assaulted him. They held Bartlett at gunpoint and at one stage stuffed him into the boot of his vehicle while they drove around with him for some time, he said.Makhubele added that he was then hit in the face by the thugs before being thrown out of the car and into the veld in Zonk iZizwe near Katlehong. After being hit in the face, he was unsure of where he was and waited until it was morn- ing, when he was able to get help and call the police from a nearby house. He was robbed of his vehicle, cellphone, a shoulder bag and two gold rings - all valued at about R1.2 million, Makhubele said.He added that no arrests had been made but a manhunt was under way for the three robbers involved in Bartlett s harrowing ordeal.A case of armed robbery and hijacking is being investigated. @Lanc_02The Star

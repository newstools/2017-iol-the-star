Johannesburg â€“ Close family and friends took turns to visit struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada in hospital on Monday night as the Foundation announced that his condition was serious. Nelson Mandela Foundation CEO Sello Hatang, politician and Ahmed Kathrada Foundation board member Max Sisulu, close friend Barbara Hogan, and Kathrada's niece Zohra were some of the people who were seen walking in and out of the Joburg hospital where the ANC stalwart is being treated. Kathrada, 87, was admitted at the health institution almost three weeks ago to remove a clot from his brain. Although his condition was said to be stable post-surgery, it deteriorated after he contracted pneumonia as a result of post-surgery complications.  #Kathrada's condition worsens Kathrada on the road to recovery Prayer service held at Liliesleaf Farm for #Kathrada Kathrada doing well, conscious after surgery  According to the Foundation CEO Neeshan Balton, the pneumonia has affected both of Kathrada's lungs.

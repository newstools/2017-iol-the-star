Cape Town – A Cape Town man died a hero after rescuing a woman from armed hijackers. The 30-year-old man was shot and killed while pelting stones at the suspects. On Monday afternoon, Lusindiso Ngcefa, 30, was walking down Swartklip Road, Mandalay, when he noticed two men dragging a woman out of her Opel Corsa. Police say the woman was struggling to unbuckle her seatbelt as hijackers forced her out of the car. Lusindiso began throwing stones at the suspects in an attempt to scare them off. One of the suspects turned around and shot him in the head. Pastor Kenny McDillon, who passed the scene, managed to track down the man’s family in Khayelitsha after sharing a photo of him on Facebook. “I was on my way to Philippi when I saw a young woman running to a gentleman who was lying on the ground and who was bleeding from the head,” Pastor Kenny says. “I decided with discretion to take photographs of the man while he lay there to find his family.” After his post went viral on Facebook, Pastor Kenny found the man’s family: “I was given the number of his sister and I apologised for placing it on Facebook, but they were grateful.” The pastor will now financially assist the family with transporting the body to the Eastern Cape for burial. “We will be meeting with the family and we hope to set up a fund to give him a dignified burial,” he says. Police spokesperson, Captain FC van Wyk, says no arrests have been made. “The victim was standing at the robots with her silver Corsa vehicle, when two unidentified males opened her door and removed her while she still had her seatbelt on,” he says. “A 30-year-old male pedestrian who witnessed the hijacking threw stones at the hijackers while they were removing the victim from the vehicle. One of the suspects then took out a firearm and shot the pedestrian in the head." “The male was taken to Groote Schuur Hospital, but died due to his injuries." “The vehicle, a silver Corsa, was found later abandoned in Swartklip Road.” Daily Voice

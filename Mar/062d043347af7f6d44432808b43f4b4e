Makhura visited the family home of the actor, comedian and musician in Kew, north-east of Joburg on Wednesday. “He had an important impact on the lives of ordinary people and families across the length and breadth of the country. “He was a celebrated actor and musician. Whatever form the funeral will take I have no doubt that as the Gauteng provincial government working with the family we would like to give him a fitting farewell.” PAC spokesman Kenneth Mokgatlhe said the party demanded that Mafela, who died at the weekend, be given a provincial funeral. Mokgatlhe said: “His continuous immense contribution at the worst times of apartheid makes him a great man. “He continued to inspire and discover the current youthful talents and will always be an embodiment of inspiration to all who wish to pursue careers in film industry. His song Shebeleza is very close to our hearts rather than our ears.” Mafela, 75, who had starring roles in local soapies, movies as well as Sgudi ‘Snaysi, Going Up and Madam and Eve died in a car crash. Close friend and playwright Welcome Msomi said it was hard to accept Mafela's death. “You keep telling yourself it is not true.” A memorial service for Mafela will be held at the Joburg Theatre at 11am on Thursday.

 Cape Town – Struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada has died aged 87. The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation said Kathrada passed away on Tuesday morning at the Donald Gordon Hospital in Johannesburg.  "Kathrada passed away peacefully after a short period of illness, following surgery to the brain," the foundation said.  Neeshan Balton, Executive Director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, confirmed that the anti-apartheid struggle veteran “breathed his last today”.  “This is great loss to the ANC, the broader liberation movement and South Africa as a whole. Internationally, he was staunch in his support for the Palestinian struggle. ‘Kathy’ was an inspiration to millions in different parts of the world,” said Balton.  Kathrada Foundation Chairperson, Derek Hanekom, was overcome with emotion saying he has lost a “revolutionary mentor and dear friend”.  “Comrade Kathy was a gentle, humane and humble soul. He was a determined revolutionary who gave his entire life to the liberation struggle in our country,” he added.  Kathrada will be buried according to Muslim religious rights, details of which will be made publicly available in due course, the foundation said.The ANC veteran was among the Rivonia Triallists who stood trial for treason along with Nelson Mandela between 1963 and 1964. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964. He spent the next 18 years behind bars and consigned to manual labour on Robben Island. In October 1982, he joined Madiba at Pollsmoor Prison. He was later released and served as a member of Parliament for the ANC.

Johannesburg An All-South African cast will bring to life the story of Struggle icon Solomon Mahlangu. The film, written and directed by Mandla Dube, tells the story of Mahlangu as a young man who became the voice of many youths when no one was listening to them.Mahlangu, known as Kalushi, used his arrest and trial to speak for the masses. He was sentenced to death at the age of 23. The cast includes Thabo Rametsi as Mahlangu, Thabo Malema, Louw Venter, Marcel van Heerden, Welile Nzuza and Shika Budhoo. Poet and playwright Dr Gcina Mhlophe plays the role of Mahlangu s mother, Martha. Pearl Thusi, who recently starred in US series Quantico, is also one of the talented actors in the film. Mahlangu s brother Lucas was a cultural adviser to the production. It is interesting to note that the campaign organisers from #FeesMustFall called me to ask if they can rename Wits Great Hall after Solomon Mahlangu and I introduced them to the family, said Dube. The director said Mahlangu was someone who to this day offered hope to young people. His story demonstrates how the strength of the human spirit can triumph, even under the most difficult and oppressive circumstances. In a way, I made this film with my students in mind. The film won an award at the 2016 Rapid Lion International Film Festival. It was also screened at the Durban International Film Festival where it was hailed by audiences and critics alike. It was screened at the Cannes Marche 2016 and the KykNET Silwerskermfees. The film has also been invited to screen at numerous festivals. It opens in cinemas on March 10. On Saturday, its official launch premiere will take place at Ster Kinekor Sterland in Pretoria. The Star

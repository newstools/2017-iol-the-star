Johannesburg – Stores and branding belonging to one of South Africa’s leading adult entertainment chains have fallen prey to several attacks over the past two years. Luvland has been subjected to at least 12 acts of vandalism, the most recent on Wednesday at its Linden branch on Bram Fischer Drive. Operations manager Patrick Meyer said that around 4:45pm, rocks were thrown at the store before gunshots were fired at it. When The Star visited the store on Thursday, there were several bullet holes in the "open" sign and branding on the outer walls as well as a bullet fragment lodged in between the bricks. One of the shop attendants reportedly heard a clanging sound outside, and when she went to look, a shot just missed her. “We opened this particular store about two months ago and this is not the first incident we’ve had. Four months ago, someone purposefully reversed their car into our Luvland store in Constantia Park in Pretoria," Meyer said. “Our banners have also been burnt and vandalised, and one of our trailers was thrown into the Vaal Dam." “I don’t know who it is or if it’s just people who don’t want the stores in these areas, but we are fully licensed, we’re a classy adult store." “Forty-five percent of our customers are women, who come in and feel comfortable visiting us,” he said. Meyer said he was concerned about the situation, and added that these attacks weren't good for business. Police were on the scene of the Linden store on Wednesday and are investigating the matter. @Lanc_02 The Star

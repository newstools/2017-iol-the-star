Johannesburg ANC Struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada is recuperating in a Joburg hospital after undergoing surgery relating to blood clotting on the brain. He had been admitted initially for dehydration.Kathrada, 87, is a Rivonia Trialist and was sentenced to life in prison in 1964, most of which he served on Robben Island, being released in 1989 alongside other Struggle stalwarts. Kathrada, despite being ill prior to the operation, was in good spirits, doctors said. The operation was successful and he is in a stable condition, they said.Neeshan Balton, director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, said it would be some time before Kathrada fully recovered. Due to hospital regulations and the requirement of a relaxed period of recovery, only visits from the immediate family would be permitted, Balton said. We do however wish to thank the public as well as Kathrada s many friends and comrades for their well wishes and support.&quot; We hope that you continue remembering him in your prayers and take time to reflect on the ideals and values that he and his generation stood for, said Balton.Kathrada is one of three Rivonia Trialists still alive today, the other two being Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg.

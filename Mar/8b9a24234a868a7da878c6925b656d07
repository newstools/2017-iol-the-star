Jantjies, now 26, is still the man in the Lions hot seat, and he’s still up there with the best No 10s around, but there are now growing calls for Bosch to be the next man to don the Springbok flyhalf jersey, and not Jantjies. It is not surprising Bosch, who was a star in the junior ranks, is being talked about as the next big thing, considering the influential role he has played in helping the Sharks to register four wins in five outings so far in Super Rugby this year. Whether at flyhalf - in place of the injured Pat Lambie - or at fullback, Bosch has shone for the Sharks this season, but he faces a huge challenge this weekend. Jantjies has not quite hit top form this season, but he’s been steady enough and may just blossom this weekend in what is the Lions’ biggest game to date this year. He loves playing at Ellis Park and often produces his best in local derbies. This is a big one for Bosch  he’s up against a team that hasn’t lost at home in eight previous Super Rugby matches, that loves playing in front of their own fans and he’ll face plenty of pressure from the Lions’ loose-forwards and their back division. The question is how will the rookie cope on the big stage? It’s a showdown that all of South Africa has been waiting for. Let the epic battle commence. Pretoria News

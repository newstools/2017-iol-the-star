Johannesburg – ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said the party was unhappy with President Jacob Zuma's decision to fire Pravin Gordhan as finance minister in a cabinet reshuffle that has rocked South Africa's markets and currency. "We were given a list that was complete, and in my own view as a secretary I felt like this list has been developed somewhere else and was given to us to legitimise it," Mantashe told Talk Radio 702. "The process made me a little bit jittery and uncomfortable," Mantashe, who is the second most powerful individual in the ANC after Zuma, said on Friday. Reuters

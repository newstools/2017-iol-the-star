Johannesburg – Five suspects have apparently been arrested in connection with the multi-million rand robbery that took place at OR Tambo International Airport. According to a source close to the investigation, five men were arrested in Gauteng between Friday and Saturday. One is said to be a member of SAPS, while three others are said to be security personnel working at the airport. “One of them is a police officer, the other three are security who work at the airport, and a Zimbabwean national was also arrested,” said the source.  This comes nearly a week after the Acting National Police Commissioner, Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane, announced that four suspects, including a police officer, were initially arrested. Two of the four men taken in at the time appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court on charges of armed robbery. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi could not confirm the arrests, but said he was aware of a message that was circulating on social media pertaining to the arrests. “The information cannot be verified at this point, but the nation will be updated through the acting national commissioner if there is a breakthrough in the case,” Mulaudzi said. Earlier this month, a total of 27 parcels containing foreign currency, apparently amounting to R20 million, were taken when a group of armed robbers travelling in a SAPS branded vehicle accessed a restricted section of the airport. They fled with the parcels which are said to have been destined for London on a SAA flight. The Star

Exact detail to the cause of the crash is still speculative and will form part of the police investigation, Botha said. Paramedics arrived at the scene and found that the taxi was ripped apart, accident debris and the injured commuters were spread over a large area. After the injured were triaged it was found that nine people tragically died on impact, two were in a critical condition while four people sustained serious injuries, he said.Botha added that paramedics spoke to the driver while transporting him.

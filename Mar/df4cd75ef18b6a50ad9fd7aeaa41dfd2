Johannesburg Following a report in The Star about the dangers children face crossing a river in the village of Ga-Sekgopo in Limpopo, the South African Institute of Civil Engineers (SAICE) has expressed interest in helping to build a bridge.Last month, the plight of children crossing the chasm, especially during rainstorms, when the river rages and the current becomes too strong to do so, was highlighted. For many children, crossing this large, nameless riverbed, which partially separates the two parts of Ga-Sekgopo, is their only means of getting to their school, which is on the other side of the riverbank.There have also been several deaths and close calls in recent years after children had made attempts to cross the river during heavy rains.Manglin Pillay, chief executive of SAICE, said it was &quot;absolutely unacceptable and incredibly saddening&quot; that, 23 years into democracy, stories like this were still prevalent in South Africa.He said that what was even more disheartening was the prevalence of such horror stories existing parallel to clearly accessible solutions. How is it that this country has hundreds of unemployed engineers, when it is very evident that there is a genuine need for engineering capacity to pursue the national demands of social and economic development?&quot;&quot;And why is there inadequate project rollout from the biggest civil engineering client government when the development goals have already been announced from the highest points of administration in the country, to the tune of some R800 billion over the coming years? he questioned. Fundamental structures such as proper roads and bridges are required for the functioning of a community and societies, Pillay emphasised.He said it was stories like this that reminded South Africans that having proper infrastructure isn t just about delivering on promises made, it s about accessibility as well as ensuring the safety and well-being of our citizens . No child, especially in a democratic country, should be struggling or dying in the process to access their right to education, Pillay stressed.&quot;This story paints a clear picture of not only how the government keeps failing our people, but also how denying people proper infrastructure is another way of delaying them in realising their fundamental human rights,&quot; he added.The bridge project is currently in its planning phase, and SAICE, together with The Star, have called on any individuals who would like to help with financing the project to get in contact. @Lanc_02The Star

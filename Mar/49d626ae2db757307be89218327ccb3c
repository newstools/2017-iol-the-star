Cape Town – Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has been put in charge of the country's purse, replacing Pravin Gordhan, who has been enshrined in controversy involving President Jacob Zumba and the controversial Gupta family. Gigaba is one of the high-profile figures who had not spoken at the funeral of former president Nelson Mandela's close friend, Ahmed Kathrada, this week. Kathrada, who died on Wednesday morning, had been vocal about Zuma and the state of the economy. Kathrada had in an open letter pleaded that Zuma step down. Gigaba defended: "The veterans of the ANC do not influence the masses of the people... our view is that as the custodians of the values and ethos of the ANC and culture and tradition of the movement, they know what they ought to have done to raise those issues." The man touted as new Finance Minister had also been vocal against what he had called the "super exploitation" of foreign nationals. Malusi, had at the time condemned what he said were practices which haunted mainly the hospitality and construction industries. Gigaba emphasised all businesses had to employ at least 60% South Africans. "This has nothing to do with xenophobia, in fact xenophobic violence is what we want to prevent,” Gigaba said in an interview with the Cape Argus. “We must prioritise the employment of South Africans, and businesses across the board have to comply."

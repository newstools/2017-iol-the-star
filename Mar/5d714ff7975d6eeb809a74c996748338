Johannesburg – The University of Johannesburg (UJ) this week will be hosting its first set of graduation ceremonies in its newly rebuilt Sanlam Auditorium, after it was torched last year. The university said it cost an estimated R100 million to repair the auditorium and the computer labs above it, which were destroyed in a fire-bombing in May last year in an incident believed to be connected to #FeesMustFall. “There were contributions from former students but it didn’t amount to much money. Most of the money used was from the insurance and the university’s budget,” said spokesperson Kaamini Reddy. Reddy noted that a record number of students would be graduating over the next few weeks. “Almost 9 500 students will graduate at the university’s newly refurbished auditorium, after the 1000-seater auditorium was scorched,” she added. Among these are 4 915 undergraduate degrees, 2 614 undergraduate diplomas and 1 967 at postgraduate level. Thirty-eight doctoral degrees will be awarded while 1 600 honours degrees and 204 master’s degrees are to be conferred. The graduates include students from the university’s four campuses across all nine faculties. Following investigations by police, the Hawks and forensic investigators, 17 students were found to have allegedly taken part in the arson attack. The university embarked on disciplinary action against the students who were identified as having been involved. @Lanc_02 The Star

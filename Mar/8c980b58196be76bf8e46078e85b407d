Police say a warrant of arrest has been issued for the former midfielder who played professional football at Platinum Stars and Chippa United. Earlier in his career, he had a stint as a youth player who also went for trials at England’s Tottenham Hotspur. The alleged rape occured four years ago while he was playing for Chippa United when that team was still based in Cape Town. The 26-year-old wizard is alleged to have also absconded from the team, leading to disciplinary proceedings being brought against him. Platinum Stars coach Cavin Johnson had described Zongo’s disappearance from the club as a sad story during an interview with a TV news channel last year. On Thursday, police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “Police attached to Bellville Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (unit) are seeking the assistance of the public in tracing the whereabouts of Masibusane Zongo. He is wanted for a rape case that was reported in February 2013 and a warrant for his arrest was issued.” Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of Zongo is requested to contact investigating officer Van Zyl on 021592 7092 or 082 522 1095. Information can also be shared to Crime Stop on 08600 1011 or SMS Crime Line on 32211. The Star

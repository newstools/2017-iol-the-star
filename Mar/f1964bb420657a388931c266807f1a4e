JOHANNESBURG – Cheetahs boss Franco Smith has recalled fit again centres Francois Venter and Nico Lee to his starting team for Saturday’s Super Rugby match against the Sharks in Bloemfontein. Captain Venter, who has yet to play this season after undergoing surgery in December to mend a broken ankle, returns to lead the side against the men from Durban, and he’ll team up with Lee, his midfield partner that terrorised opponents in the Currie Cup last season. In a further boost to the side’s chances of picking up a victory, wing Sergeal Petersen is also back following four weeks on the sidelines after hurting his knee in his team’s first round match against the Lions. It is a much-changed team from the one that got a hiding from the Jaguares in Buenos Aires a week ago. Fred Zeilinga is also back at No 10, while Shaun Venter will be his scrumhalf partner. Justin Basson also returns to the second row while in the front row coach Smith has opted for Johan Coetzee, hooker Torsten van Jaarsveld and exciting loosehead Ox Nche. The Cheetahs have picked up two wins from their four games so far – against the Bulls and Sunwolves – and are second in their conference with nine points, four less than the unbeaten Stormers. The match against the Sharks on Saturday kicks off at 5.15pm in Bloemfontein. Cheetahs: @jacq_west  jacques.vdwesthuyzen@inl.co.za  Independent Media

Cape Town – More trouble is looming for embattled Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Already facing the axe in an imminent cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma, and in a court battle with the Gupta family, more bad news emerged in Parliament on Wednesday. National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams confirmed that the Hawks were still investigating him over the Sars “rogue unit”. Abrahams told the portfolio committee on justice and correctional services Gordhan’s investigation was ongoing. However, he would not give further details, saying only that the Hawks were still investigating the finance minister. Werner Horn, of the DA, raised the question about Gordhan when Abrahams presented the NPA’s plans for the next three years. Horn accused Abrahams of leaving out information on Gordhan’s future. But ANC MP Loyiso Mpumlwana said this was a political question, and called for it not to be allowed. Steve Swart, of the ACDP, said the committee had discussed the matter last year, and there was nothing political about it. After wrangling by MPs, committee chairperson Mathole Motshekga said Abrahams could answer the question. Abrahams said: “The reality is that it is under investigation by the police.” He said the Hawks were still busy with the probe. This week, Zuma ordered Gordhan back to the country, cutting short an international investor roadshow he had been attending, thus fuelling speculation that he was about to be fired. His deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, who was supposed to undertake the US leg of the visit, was also ordered not to travel to Boston and New York. Abrahams also told the committee that Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi, the deputy directors of public prosecutions, remained on special leave. They were struck off the roll last September. They have since appealed. Politics Bureau

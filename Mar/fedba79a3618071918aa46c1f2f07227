Cape Town - The owner of a larney car which was reportedly bought with cash stolen in a brazen airport heist has denied any involvement in the robbery, and says he bought the car years ago. The Joburg man and a policeman were among five people who appeared in court following a daring R200 million cash heist at OR Tambo International Airport on March 7. The suspects, facing a charge of armed robbery, appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, after their arrest over the weekend. This brings to seven the number of suspects arrested so far. Three of the suspects are believed to be security guards based at the airport. The case has been remanded to March 28 and 29 for a bail application. Meanwhile, the white Lamborghini doing the rounds on social media was not bought with the stolen cash, the owner’s lawyer said. It’s also emerged that the person standing next to the car in the picture is not a suspect, but a police investigator, and took to social media to correct the matter. Attorney Victor Nkhwashe says his client Tando Sonqishe bought the car three years ago. Sonqishe described himself as a businessman and made headlines in 2015 when he sued a car dealership for refusing to return a R1.1m deposit he paid for a Porsche 911. Meanwhile Acting National Commissioner, Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane, said they are investigating who and how the photograph, part of police evidence, was leaked to journalists. Daily Voice

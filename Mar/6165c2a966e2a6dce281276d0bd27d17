The City of Joburg has apologised to residents who have received incorrect pre-termination notices as a result of a "system glitch". City spokesperson Kgamanyane Maphologela said customers who had received incorrect pre-termination notices after they have paid their accounts on time should ignore the notice. Furthermore, he said, all charges relating to the issuing of the pre-termination notices would be reversed. Customers were encouraged to pay their municipal bills as per their normal due dates. “We encourage customers to always pay their accounts on time - on the due date - and in full. Customers should immediately make payment arrangements if they are unable to pay to avoid attracting credit control actions against them,” said Maphologela.  For more information, visit any customer service centre or phone the city’s call centre on 0860 562 874.  Lastly, said Maphologela, customers should remember that if they pay at any third party, such as retail outlets, on the due date, it would reflect on the system only three days later, therefore credit control would kick in. @annacox The Star

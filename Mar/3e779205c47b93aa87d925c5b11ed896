The video shows the officers in a marked vehicle shoving their hands into the men’s pockets. City of Joburg member of the mayoral committee for public safety Michael Sun said as soon as he saw the video on social media, which was recorded on Saturday near Albertina Sisulu Street in Bez Valley, he requested senior JMPD officials to trace the patrol vehicle as the number plate is clearly visible in the video, and the officers involved.   “The JMPD internal affairs team and senior directors worked around the clock to investigate the incident. The two officers involved were taken to Jeppe police station, where they were detained. They are facing charges of corruption and will be appearing at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court. The officers also face internal disciplinary processes and will be dismissed if found guilty,” Sun said. The men had been transferred to non-uniform duties. They had been given notices of intention of suspension and had seven days in which to respond. “Corruption is public enemy number one and will not be tolerated. Our department is mandated with the task of keeping the residents of this city safe. There is no place in the department of public safety for any metro police officer or members of the department found to be involved in criminal activities,” Sun added. The Star

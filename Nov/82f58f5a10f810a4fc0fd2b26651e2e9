Singing sensation Paxton Fielies, 17, has won the coveted Idols SA 2017 title, becoming the youngest winner of the SA version of the competition's history. The Grade 11 pupil, from Bishop Lavis, Cape Town, beat KwaZulu-Natal's 25-year-old Mthokozisi Ndaba in what host Proverb described as a "unanimous" win. “You have no choice but to be a super star,” Idols SA judge Somizi said just a few minutes before Paxton was announced as Season 13's winner. It was during the Cape Town auditions that Paxton was the first to get four big yeses to receive her golden ticket, sending her straight to theatre week. It was a long journey, and it ended beautifully for the teenager.

Cape Town - The Democratic Alliance (DA) is set to write to the Secretary of Police, Alvin Rapea, to request an investigation of the expenditure of over R52 million on torches. According to reports, the South African Police Service (SAPS) has paid Forensic Data Analysts (FDA) over R52 million for a contract for 169 torches. "The invoice for the contract was paid for by the section in which former Acting National Police Commissioner General Khomotso Phahlane’s wife works. FDA is owned by a businessman that has been implicated in potentially corrupt transactions with Phahlane through the provision of luxury vehicles to him and his wife," the DA said. The opposition party also calls for an analysis project of the SAPS expenditure over the last five financial years by the Civilian Secretariat in a bid to  "closely scrutinise potentially irrational or wasteful large contracts." It is believed that the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) is investigating suspicious transactions between SAPS and FDA. DA slammed the under-staffing and lack of resources at police stations. "The DA have always suspected and can only conclude that the SAPS budget continues to be misspent due to skewed priorities and irrational procurement in supply chain management." IOL

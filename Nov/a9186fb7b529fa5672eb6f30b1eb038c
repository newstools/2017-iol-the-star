Durban - The Durban North and Umhlanga areas were hit by two house robberies within an hour of each-other on Wednesday afternoon. In the second case, shots were fired as a neighbour gave chase.  Marshall Security spokesman Kyle van Reenen said in the first incident, seven armed men forced entry into a home in Westridge Road in Umhlanga and held up the female homeowner at gun point. The men ransacked the home, making off with a large amount of jewelry and a safe before fleeing in an awaiting getaway vehicle. About 45 minutes later, at around 2.15pm, van Reenen said seven armed suspects derailed a driveway gate to a home in Kenneth Kaunda (Northway), before forcing entry into the home by breaking a security door and gate with a crowbar.  "The home-owner's children were home and locked themselves in a bedroom while the men ransacked the house, making off with undisclosed items," van Reenen said. "Before the suspects could flee, the homeowner returned home. Noticing his driveway gate open, the man suspected the worst and was confronted by an armed suspect. The homeowner and his daughter who was in the vehicle with him at the time, fled on foot for safety, while the suspects fled the home towards Blackburn Road. "A neighbour who witnessed the incident, gave chase, pursuing the vehicle to the intersection of Kenneth Kaunda and Swapo (Broadway), where the suspects fired a shot at him. The vehicle fled towards Chris Hani (North Coast) Road."  Van Reenen said there were no injuries, however the victims were understandably traumatised and the Durban North Umhlanga Crisis Team was brought in to counsel them.  South African Police Services are investigating. The Independent on Saturday

Durban - Police are investigating the death of a former Pietermaritzburg woman after her body was found in a cupboard in her Sandton apartment. Lerusha Naidoo’s death comes shortly after her father, prominent businessman Morgan Naidoo, was found murdered last year. Morgan, a pharmacy owner, was found dead on the N3. His 27-year-old daughter, living in Sandton, Johannesburg, was found dead on Sunday. Lerusha, an honours graduate, had been working as a consultant for IQ Business in Sandton. Her body was found in her flat on Sunday morning when her friend raised the alarm after failing to get hold of her. She was found hanging in a clothing cupboard. Police are questioning two people and are awaiting the outcome of a post-mortem examination. According to sources close to the investigation in Johannesburg, Lerusha had entertained guests at her apartment on Saturday night and had last spoken to her family in Pietermaritzburg at about 10pm. She had spent the previous two weekends with them in KwaZulu-Natal. It is believed a friend tried contacting her on Sunday and then went to the flat to look for Lerusha after repeated calls went unanswered. Upon arriving at the flat, the friend found that Lerusha’s car was in its parking bay, but there was no answer when the friend knocked at her door and called out for her. The door was eventually forced open and Lerusha’s body was discovered. Investigations are continuing. * Morgan had been missing for four days before he was found at the bridge at the Lynnfield Park N3 on-ramp. He had been blindfolded with his hands tied behind his back and he had sustained three gunshot wounds. Morgan, who lived in Hayfields, hailed from a prominent business family and was himself a successful businessman with various retail interests in the Midlands. He was the former owner of the Alexandra Road Superette and also owned several pharmacies, including one in Camperdown and another in Richmond. His murder remains unsolved. POST

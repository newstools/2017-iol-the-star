Somizi Mhlongo has offered Emtee some unsolicited advice after the local rapper's penis caused an online frenzy when he accidently live broadcast his manhood while using the bathroom. Speaking on his Metro FM Breakfast show with DJ Fresh on Tuesday, Somizi blamed Emtee's entourage for the incident. The 'Idols SA' judge claims the 'Roll Up' hitmaker's 'yes friends' did not have his best interests at heart. "For me, it was a mistake but one that could have been avoided from the onset. It worries me when I see a career that is doing well and a talented young man making stupid mistakes because you're surrounded with fans that are disguised as friends." Emtee: Get off my d*** Emtee, whose real name is Mthembeni Ndevu, has since apologised to fans, but that did not stop tweeps — or Somizi — from poking fun at his manhood. Making reference to jokes criticising the size of Emtee's manhood, Somizi said: "Console yourselves all you want. All I am saying is if you are short, you can only stretch your arm to a certain extent. If you are tall you are tall." The 25-year-old rapper is not the first star whose private parts have been thrust into the spotlight under public scrutiny. Last year, Bafana Bafana midfielder Bongani Zungu found himself in hot water after a leaked video of the star fondling himself in the shower went viral. And comedian and TV personality Siv Ngesi made headlines twice for showing off both his front and rear assets.  Last September Siv shared a picture of himself standing ringside wearing a pair of tight blue shorts. The internet literally exploded with fans fawning over his uhm. shorts.   However, the stunt he pulled at the end of an interview with 5FM radio host Thando Thabethe in June had the opposite effect on fans. Siv dropped his shorts and wiggled his behind while posing for an in-studio picture with Thando and her team — and while some were lovin' it, many wanted to 'unsee it'.

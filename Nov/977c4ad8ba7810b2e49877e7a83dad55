According to reports, 'Idols SA' runner-up Mthokozisi Ndaba is not fairing well after losing the title to Cape Town's Paxton Fielies in the competition's Sunday night finale. After 17-year-old Paxton was announced as the winner, KwaZulu-Natal's Mthokozisi Ndaba walked off staged and has reportedly denied any interview requests. M-Net's head of PR, Nondumiso Mabece, reportedly said the 25-year-old runner-up has requested space to come to terms with losing the competition. "Mthokozisi has requested to be given time to come to terms with the result of the Idols show. He will indicate when he is ready to speak to the media," Mabece told TshisaLive. "He is currently receiving assistance to deal with emotions involved in this situation." Ndaba has been through many challenges in his life, having lost all his family members including his newborn baby. He told the Sunday Tribune last month that he planned to release his album with a book detailing his life’s pains and his Idols journey. The book would be titled 'Pain and Fame'. Both contestants usually attend a press conference after the end of the show but pictures on social media saw an empty chair with Mthokozisi's name on it.

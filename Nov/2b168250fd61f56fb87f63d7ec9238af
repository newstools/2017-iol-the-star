Singing sensation Paxton Fielies from Bishop Lavis, Cape Town has won the coveted Idols SA 2017 title. The 17-year-old beat Mthokozisi Ndaba, 25, from KwaZulu-Natal to become the youngest winner of the competition. She is only in Grade 11. Fielies and Ndaba will both release music videos. It was during the Cape Town auditions that Paxton Fielies was the first to get four big yeses to receive her golden ticket, sending her straight to theatre week. It was a long journey, and it ended beautifully for the teenager. “I have definitely grown, not only as a person but as an artist. I’ve learnt a lot, not only about myself but also about the industry and how tough it is out here,” Fielies said before tonight's big finale. The teen walks away with a brand new Ford Focus, R1 000 000, in cash prize, R50 000 worth of a fashion voucher from Truworths, R20 000 of musical instrument from YAMAHA, and a recording deal. IOL

These statistics, described by authorities as tragic, are laid bare in the 2016/17 state of safety report released by the Rail Safety Regulator (RSR) yesterday. “Tragically,” said the report, there were 495 fatalities and 2079 injuries in accidents involving Metrorail and Transnet locomotives over the last year. “This shows an increase of 5% in fatalities from the previous period, and amounts to almost two deaths a day, while the 10% decrease in injuries still means almost six people are injured daily,” said the report. RSR chief executive Nkululeko Poya said fatalities concerned the regulator the most because they seemed difficult to reduce. They have been hovering between 450 and 490 over the last seven years. The fatalities figure was its highest since 2010/11, a year in which 456 people died on rail. In 2014/15, 473 people lost their lives and 453 died during 2015/16. A total of 4 066 Metrorail and Transnet accidents occurred over the year, a 5% decrease from the 4250 in 2015/16. At 944, the number of collisions involving Transnet trains show a worrying trend. Transnet reduced derailments from 718 in 2013/14 to 268 over the past year. “It remains concerning to note occurrences involving derailments, collisions, operational train fires and spillages of dangerous goods continue to dominate the Transnet operational occurrences,” said the report. “These types of occurrences could lead to a delay in trains, negatively affecting reliability and availability of freight services by rail.” Metrorail saw 45 collisions and 28 derailments. A total of 460 people died after being struck by the company’s trains, while 189 lost their lives after being hit by Transnet locomotives. The report showed train surfing remained a deadly game, as 140 surfers died. The figure was 163 in 2014/15 and 131 last year. A boy, believed to be 17, plunged to his death in Tembisa three months ago while surfing. Said the report: “The number of level-crossing occurrences, people struck by trains, occurrences in which people travel outside the train ('train surfing') and electric shock occurrences increased in the same period.” An analysis of root causes pointed to human factors, Poya said. He said under-staffing of safety officers, poor levels of supervision, communication deficiencies, theft and vandalism, signalling and infrastructure defects “remain areas of concern”.

It's 2017 guys ... â€” AKA (@akaworldwide) November 10, 2017  I just want a nice rack. ðŸ’° â€” AKA (@akaworldwide) November 10, 2017  Besides, the balls this guy has to have to try and fill FNB stadium .... by himself. You gotta at least respect that. â€” AKA (@akaworldwide) November 10, 2017  Let's do it like, watch the throne style .... each guy on either side of the stadium, on a crazy LED cube or whatever and go back to back. â€” AKA (@akaworldwide) November 10, 2017  I just want my cheese. We don't have to be best friends or nothing like that. But I KNOW that we respect each other on some level. â€” AKA (@akaworldwide) November 10, 2017   Nywe Nywe Nywe Nywe#JustBuyATicketBroer pic.twitter.com/afBOHvQWBu  â€” #LateNiteRide ðŸ“» (@ThePresident_SA) November 10, 2017   #JustBuyATicketBroerYou guys are fast.

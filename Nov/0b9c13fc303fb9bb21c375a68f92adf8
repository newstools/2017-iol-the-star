Hosted by acousticsNOW, the Bob Dylan Subterranean Songbook Tribute comes in time to kick off the festive season. “In deference to the indelible marks of Dylan’s raw genius, acousticsNOW has assembled a collection of South Africa’s leading acoustic musicians to explore, interpret and rehearse a unique programme of Dylan’s profound work, which controversially earned him the Nobel Prize for literature,” event organisers said. Dylan’s contribution to popular culture and music was arguably unmatched. He dominated the music, song-writing, painting and literature world for about five decades. In the tribute, seven acoustic musicians will present a full day's outdoor concert of their own renderings of Dylan's popular and obscure works at the end of the month at the Nirox Foundation Sculpture Park in Krugersdorp. The seven musicians are Dayne Rothbletz, solo rock artist Jon Shaban and fellow rock music artist Adelle Nqeto, Be Brave hitmaker Shotgun Tori, Tubatsi Moloi and the acclaimed Jamie Acheson. Apart from the artists' renditions of Dylan’s work, tribute-goers will be entertained by the sounds of additional instrumentation such as the violin, harmonica, bass, tambourine and Tubatse Moloi's ethereal flute. They will be soothed by sounds of Dylan while indulging in the finest  cuisine which will be on offer from  several food stalls. Gates to the event open at 10am on Saturday, November 25, and the concert starts at 11am. Tickets cost R340 per person online and R360 at the gate. It's half-price for children under 12 and free for infants under two. For more info, see www.acousticsnow.org

“I am a single mother with two children. We don’t have a home at the moment and it has always been my dream to have a home for my son Alu, 8, and daughter Sange, 15,” she said. Kom said she was still numb, excited and overwhelmed after finding out that she had won the R3 million home. “I’ve been anxious the whole week, I have bumped my car and I cried - yes I did; you would have done exactly the same,” she said. “I lost everything that I worked for last year, and through relationships I have built with my friends, I was fortunate enough that one of my friends took me into their home with my children.” Kom and her son were flown to Joburg to inspect three homes, and she chose a house that was designed by Team Visi: Mpho Mphaga and Lesego Masekela. Win a Home producer Lars Schwinges said six finalists were randomly selected from hundreds of thousands of viewer entries to stand a chance of winning their choice of one of the three luxury cluster homes decorated by the Design Duos. “Throughout the show, viewers could vote for their favourite design duo as part 
of their entry into the grand prize competition of winning a home. “It was a close call, but Team House and Leisure pipped the others to the post and captured the hearts of the public. As the winners of Viewers’ Choice, they received a cash prize of R20000,” said Schwinges. The three design duos who participated were partners Abiah “Superstar” Mahlase and Brad Muttitt, best friends Banele Khoza and Tshepo Sealetsa, and complete strangers before the show, Mphaga and Masekela.  The winning duo were Mahlase and Muttitt, who have a boost in their bank balance of R100 000, for their razzle-dazzle and unconventional style. The flamboyant and bold couple, who also have a fashion label called AMEN, have said the win is a “wonderful foundation” upon which they can build an interior design business as “an extension of our creative careers”.

Bingwa joined the station in July to present afternoon drive, and settled into his role quickly, proving to be popular with 702 listeners. “Bongani is a natural drive-time host - he brings personality, curiosity and a critical eye to all the stories of the day, and listener feedback has been exceedingly positive,” said the 702 station manager, Thabisile Mbete. “We believe he is the right person to lead audiences through the many complex issues that affect our lives in Gauteng.” Stephen Grootes will move into the afternoon drive show, another key time channel for Gauteng listeners. Grootes has been filling in on the breakfast show since September, when breakfast presenter Xolani Gwala announced he would be taking some time off to receive treatment for cancer. “We are very grateful to Stephen, who stepped into the breach for his colleague and friend Xolani without hesitation, and for doing a great job” said Mbete. Grootes said: “I've loved informing people and getting them up and going in the morning, and I'm looking forward to informing them and hearing their views in the afternoons. "It has been a big news year in our wonderful, complex country and next year is likely to be the same.” Mbete added: "Xolani continues to receive treatment, and 702 looks forward to his return when he is ready. “We send heartfelt thanks to the many listeners who have sent through messages of support, advice, wishes and encouragement for Xolani.” The new line-up will come into effect from January 15.

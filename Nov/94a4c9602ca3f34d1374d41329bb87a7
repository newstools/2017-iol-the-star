It is the first of its kind and will be able to detect complications relating to diabetes six months before the disease manifests itself. The camera is able to detect any damaged nerves, which are a sign of diabetes. As it stands, there are only two machines in the country, and this is the first in Gauteng. According to Dr Timmy Kedijang of donors Novo Nordisk, most of the time, diabetes is detected in the very late stages when damage in the body has already been done. “Novo Nordisk felt compelled to make this generous donation because the hospital is one of the largest on the hemisphere. “With the large number of people suffering from diabetes, we could reduce the number at the primitive stages before it gets serious. "The machine costs roughly R1 million, but it also requires an additional R500000 to equip people to use it,” Kedijang added. Dr Sindeep Bhana, a specialist physician and endocrinologist, shared the same sentiments as Kedijang. “The typical signs and complications of diabetes could lead to more severe problems if not detected and managed at an early stage. "Having the machine unveiled here in the township could be advantageous, because the number of diabetes patients is shockingly high,” said Bhana. He added that one of the strategies they wanted to implement in an effort to eradicate diabetes was to have buses, both stationed and moving, to detect the disease among people in areas surrounding the hospital.

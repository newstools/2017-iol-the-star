The Johannesburg Italian Film Festival (JIFF) will be held for the third time in South Africa this month. Acclaimed Italian actor Raoul Bova will travel to Joburg to open the festival, which is set to take place over two days in Rosebank. Bova is known for his leading roles in several Hollywood films, including Under the Tuscan Sun, All Roads Lead to Rome and The Tourist. The festival will feature some of his biggest Italian hits such as Scusate Se Esisto - Sorry if I love you; Sei Mai Stata Sulla Luna? - Have you ever been to the moon?; Buongiorno Papa - Hello Dad; Lo * ’Altro - I, the Other; Sbirri - Cops; and La Finestra di Fronte - Facing Windows. Bova said he was excited about opening the festival. “One of the best things about my work as an actor is being able to give creativity, entertainment and emotions the chance to travel across borders and cultures,” he said. He hopes the local Italian community will enjoy these movies and that many more South Africans, who don’t necessarily have Italian origins, will come to love Italian cinema through the JIFF. The festival will be held from November 10-12 under the auspices of the consulate general of Italy in Joburg. The movies will be screened at Rosebank’s Cinema Nouveau, where entrance will be free.

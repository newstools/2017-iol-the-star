Jay-Z has branded Meek Mill's jail sentence as "unjust and heavy handed", as Kevin Hart and T.I. also come to his defence. The 30-year-old rapper was sentenced to a minimum of two years in prison on Monday (06.11.17) after violating the terms of his probation from his drug and weapons case back in 2009. And now, fellow rapper Jay-Z has slammed the court's decision to sentence Meek Mill - who could spend up to 48 months in state prison - and insisted he will "always stand by" the star. Taking to Facebook, 'The Story of O.J.' rapper wrote: "The sentence handed down by the Judge - against the recommendation of the Assistant District Attorney and Probation Officer - is unjust and heavy handed. We will always stand by and support Meek Mill, both as he attempts to right this wrongful sentence and then in returning to his musical career." Jay-Z, 47, isn't the only star to come to the 'Whatever You Need' rapper's defence, as actor Kevin Hart said he was "praying" for his close pal. Posting a picture of the pair on Instagram, Kevin wrote: "Praying for my brother @meekmill right now. God sometimes puts the toughest battles on his strongest soldiers. I'm here for you man!!!! My brother for life...Always here for you man!!! This storm will pass...Stay strong & keep your head up (sic)" Praying for my brother @meekmill right now.

He wrote on Instagram: "Was wit u then & WE STILL WIT U NOW!!! This too shall pass. You got this!!! God places the heaviest loads on the strongest backs. We got real love for u out here KING.

But if reports are confirmed, at least the former US president will find comfort in the fact that the young suitor concerned is of impeccable character as a former head boy of elite Rugby School. Suffolk teenager Rory Farquharson is understood to be the student caught locking lips with Malia Obama last weekend at Harvard. The pair were seen kissing ahead of the annual Harvard vs Yale American football game on Saturday, DailyMail.com reported. A video shows 19-year-old Malia - who took a gap year before starting at Harvard this autumn - reaching up to put her arms around a young man before going in for a kiss.  Many celebrities, including Chelsea Clinton and Ivanka Trump, took to social media, lambasting the media for not respecting Malia's private life after the teen made headlines again this week — but this time for making smoke rings.  Last year Obama revealed Malia and his younger daughter Sasha had already started dating and was pretty relaxed about it since his wife had set ‘such a great example’ and joking that they also had Secret Service protection. The Farquharson family did not comment.

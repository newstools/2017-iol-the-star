JOBURG North Riding residents have been advised not to drink tap water following a possible contamination from a sewer pipe which was accidentally broken. Joburg Water spokesperson Eleanor Mavimbela said the area surrounded Boundary, Aureole and Spionskop streets, should not consume, or use their tap water for human consumption - drinking and cooking - until further notice due to a suspected possible sewer contamination within the water network. “Samples have been taken for testing and we expect the results latest this afternoon. All other residents of North Riding are free to use the water. The system has been flushed with chlorine and there is no cause for panic at this stage as only a few streets have been possibly affected and the residents have been informed accordingly,” she said. Water tankers will be made available for the affected  residents to use as an alternative water supply. “We are committed to provide water and sanitation that is of high quality to all residents of the city we apologise to residents for the inconvenience caused,” she added.

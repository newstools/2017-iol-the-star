DURBAN - POLICE in Johannesburg on Saturday confirmed they were investigating a case of assault after allegations that the Idols loser, Mthokozisi Ndaba, had assaulted a 21-year-old woman in Braamfontein. The Sunday Tribune was unable to reach Ndaba for comment on his cellphone after repeated attempts on Saturday. Ndaba has been on a media blackout since losing the Idols finale to young Paxton Fielies in the finale last Sunday. The victim, Neo Tsele, said she was punched and slammed to a wall by Ndaba. A spokesperson for the police at the Hillbrow Station in Johannesburg confirmed a case of assault had been opened and said there were no arrests. Meanwhile, Idols South Africa and Mzansi Magic released a statement, saying they too were unable to reach Ndaba for comment. Ndaba posted a picture with Fielies at the OR Tambo International Airport earlier on Saturday, indicating he was traveling back to KwaZulu-Natal. The official Idols Twitter account posted the statement on social media, saying they condemned “any act of abuse”.     “Mzansi Magic and Idols SA are aware of social media posts of an alleged incident that took place on 24 November. We have, however, been unable to make contact with Mthokozisi Ndaba, who has traveled back to KwaZulu-Natal. Mzansi Magic and Idols SA condemn any act of abuse. “As is the case with all of our contestants, the channel has their best interests in mind, and provides any professional support required during and after the show,” Idols said.

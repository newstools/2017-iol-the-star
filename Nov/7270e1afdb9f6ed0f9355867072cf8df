While thousands of cyclists participated in the 947 Cycle Challenge yesterday, even more showed up to support the participants.  From the early hours of yesterday, people began flocking to the Riversands Commercial Park, where the 94.7km ride around the city started and ended. From the Midrand start and finish point, supporters began streaming out along the route offering water, snacks and cheers to those who participated in the gruelling yet exhilarating race. This continued to various parts of Joburg which were all part of the official route, including Sandton, Rosebank, Parktown, Randburg and Lonehill, where young and 
old were an enthusiastic part of the festivities. A man was snapped in a picture which has since been shared on social media, holding a sign which reads "Hugs for cyclers". The Liberty Group even offered massages to encourage the cyclists to brave the Joburg sun and keep going in the 
event.  Daryl Impey was the first man to make it cross the
finish line, while Ashleigh Moolman took the honours for the women. Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba was one of those who arrived to offer their support to the cyclists, and he interacted with them and the crowd. “To the winners, congratulations, you did an excellent job. To all the participants today, well done. We will see you all next year,” Mashaba tweeted after the race.

Bloemfontein - A missing Free State farmer has been found. Louis Strydom (38), who went missing on November 16 was rescued after he was found trapped under a rock near the farm Omdraai in Bethlehem. He had been there for about five days. Isoldé Laesecke, chair of AfriForum’s Bethlehem branch, and Ruan Steinhobel of the South African Support Initiative, a non-profit that focusses on locating missing persons, received a lead on Tuesday afternoon. They combed the area where Strydom was last seen and first located his vehicle, before following his footprints. They eventually found Strydom trapped under a rock. Laesecke said they initially thought Strydom was already dead, but upon closer inspection they could however see that he was alive and immediately called in emergency services. Laesecke said it took rescue workers about three hours to stabilise and get Strydom out from under the rock. He was taken to Hoogland Mediclinic by Emer-G-Med, where he is currently recuperating. He was severely dehydrated, but sustained no further serious injuries. “We understand that the man was trapped under the rock for up to five days, with no food or water. It is a miracle that he is still alive,” said Laesecke. The Independent on Saturday

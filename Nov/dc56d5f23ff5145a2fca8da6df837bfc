Sao Paulo, Brazil - The next chapter in the new Polo story has opened with the reveal of the sedan version in Brazil on Thursday night. Although visibly based on the new-generation MQB-platform Polo hatchback, designers have done far more than just tack a boot onto the back. In fact, the newcomer looks so grown-up and comfortable in its sedan skin, not to mention quite large at 4.48 metres in length, that one wonders if there’s even a need for a Jetta anymore. Now called the Virtus, Volkswagen says that the new four-door was developed “especially” for the South American market, but it’s unlikely to be restricted to that corner of the world given the demand for small sedans in Asia and other regions. According to VWSA, the Virtus is currently under evaluation for the South African market. Local production is also a distinct possibility given that the all-new Polo hatch, due to go on sale here early next year, is being built here. Based on the MQB platform and with a wheelbase of 2.65 metres, the new Virtus is said to be the most spacious sedan in its class and the boot swallows an impressive-sounding 521 litres. Brazilian customers will get to choose between an 86kW normally aspirated 1.6 petrol and a 94kW 1-litre TSI turbopetrol, but diesel engines are also likely to be offered in various markets. The Virtus forms part of a huge 1.8 billion euro (R30bn) investment in South America, which will also result in further MQB models being produced there, including a compact bakkie that we assume will replace the Saveiro. Now wouldn’t that fill a gap in our market? IOL Motoring

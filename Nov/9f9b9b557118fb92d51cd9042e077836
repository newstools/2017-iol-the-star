Johannesburg - A video circulating on Twitter has shown a taxi driving in the emergency lane preventing an ambulance from passing. The 35-second long clip, recorded at an undisclosed location in Gauteng, shows the ambulance driving behind the taxi with its siren on, hooting and signalling to the taxi to make way. However, the taxi continues to drive faster almost as if it is racing with the emergency vehicle. It is said the ambulance vehicle was on its way to a crash scene and the video was taken from inside the ambulance by a passenger. The video was reposted by @PigSpotter and people vented and expressed their anger at the taxi driver.

Will you still allow it?”  On the other hand @quirkieee said nothing will happen to the taxi driver.

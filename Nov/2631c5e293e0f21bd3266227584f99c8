JOHANNESBURG - African champions Mamelodi Sundowns are understood to be on the verge of appointing former Sweden national coach Erik Hamren as their general manager. While the Brazilians' media officer Thulani Thuswa pleaded ignorance to this development, a journalist from Sweden's Express told Independent Media this morning that Hamren was already on his way to South Africa for a discussion with club president Patrice Motsepe. "We are writing a story about the fact that Hamren has left for South Africa for talks with Sundowns about him taking over as their general manager," said Daniel Kristofferson, a soccer journalist for Sweden's ''biggest publication". "Can you help me find out from Sundowns if this is really the case because that is what we are all hearing here in Sweden?" The Sundowns general manager position became vacant when Sizwe Nzimande resigned recently and Yugesh Signh has been acting as a caretaker since. According to Thuswa, the general manager is literally everybody's boss at the club with the administrators and the technical team reporting to him. Hamren was in charge of Sweden from 2009 to 2016 and took them to the 2012 and 2016 European Championships. The 60-year-old Swede has won league titles in both Denmark and Norway as well as having been coach of the year in both those countries.  He also won the Swedish Cup (Svenska Cupen) on three occasions with two different clubs. Should Sundowns hire a general manager with such coaching accomplishment, there are sure to be those who begin to believe that Pitso Mosimane's position as coach is under threat.

— Serves 4 Like all things that come and go, summer produce is best celebrated at its peak – which is right now The tomatoes need to marinate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes, and up to 3 hours, before serving. Ingredients 3tbs extra-virgin olive oil
2 small cloves garlic, minced
½tsp crushed red pepper flakes
450g ripe tomatoes, each cut in half if small; cored and coarsely chopped if large
1tbs sherry vinegar
1tsp kosher salt, or more as needed
1 small handful fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced Method Combine the oil, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes in a small skillet over medium heat. 
Once the garlic starts to sizzle (about 30 seconds), pour the mixture into a mixing bowl, making sure to scrape the pan with a woodenspoon to get every littlebit.
Add the tomatoes, vinegar and salt, stirring well to incorporate. 
Taste and add more salt, as needed (tomatoes love salt). 
Let the tomatoes sit for at least 15 minutes before serving, or cover them and let them sit at room temperature for up to 3 hours. 
Right before serving, stir in the basil. The Washington Post

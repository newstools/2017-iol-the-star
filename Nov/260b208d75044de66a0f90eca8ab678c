Verster was stabbed to death during a break-in at his house in Brandwacht, Stellenbosch, on Monday morning. His 14-year-old son, who also sustained injuries during the attack, was rushed to hospital.

She would not say if any items had been taken from the house. Condolences continued pouring in for Verster’s family, with some taking to social media to share their memories of him. Verster joined Absa 11 years ago as a wealth manager before quickly rising to a regional leadership role in Bloemfontein, KwaZulu-Natal and Cape Town, said Winston Monale, managing executive for Absa Wealth Management. “He was a leader, a colleague, a friend who touched and impacted everyone he had contact with. “The police are investigating and we are providing appropriate support to his close colleagues and family,” Monale said. Meanwhile, UK-based company StatPro’s chief executive, Justin Wheatley, said the family of murdered Cape Town businessman Robin Kemper were still grappling with their loss. Kemper’s decapitated body was found under a bridge in Touws River on Friday after he was reported missing by his wife, Melanie, last Tuesday. Two people have since been arrested and appeared in court in connection with his murder.

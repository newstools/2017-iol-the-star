Durban - Young MTN manager Mohamed Yusuf Janoo Joosab was murdered near Westwood Mall in Durban yesterday by three robbers who stabbed him 11 times. Joosab, 22, from Sherwood, was walking on the M13 to the mall where he worked at the MTN store as a sales manager. His assailants robbed him of his cellphone and cash before stabbing him to death. His family is devastated at the loss of their only child. Speaking on behalf of the family, the head of the Islamic Burial Council, Ahmed Paruk, described Joosab as a kind-hearted person. “His father says he would never hurt a person and was always willing to help others in any way he could.” Paruk added that Joosab’s parents were in complete shock and could not accept their son had been taken away - and so cruelly. “He lived near the mall so instead of using his vehicle, he preferred to walk as it kept him fit. The men who held him up wanted cash and his cellphone. They stabbed him 11 times thereafter,” said Paruk. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said no arrests had been made. Community activist Satish Dhupelia said it was sad to lose another innocent citizen to crime. “This is an indication that a person cannot walk to work or even take a stroll. Law enforcement officials have few resources, but why aren’t the government doing anything?” Joosub was laid to rest at the Soofie 45th Cutting cemetery yesterday. POST

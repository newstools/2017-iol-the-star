Old Mutual has confirmed there is an investigation under way into African Infrastructure Investment Managers (AIIM), one of its subsidiaries. “While we are addressing the matter urgently, we do require the necessary time to conclude the investigation and review process properly, before providing any further comment. “Our grievance and escalation procedures ensure that no individual or whistle-blower is compromised in any manner,” Old Mutual said.

One person said they suffered a nervous breakdown, was taken to hospital and then fired by Old Mutual. “This is not only happening within the subsidiary but also with the main head office. "There are countless women who are getting physically sick, or have left the company already due to their treatment of black individuals, among other things,” one person said. Another said she was not surprised by the allegations made against AIIM. “I am most surprised as this topic has always been swept under the rug, can be explained or paid to go away. "I too had a similar experience and want to stay anonymous the problem may be bigger than you think. So well done to those four ladies for ‘coming out’ (with the allegations),” the person said. The “ladies” referred to are four women who wrote to Old Mutual last month to voice concerns about about what they termed “bullying” of African and coloured women.  francesca.villette@inl.co.za  Cape Times

Yolisa Kani, chairperson of the board of directors, said the board deliberated on this matter and resolved to suspend the acting managing director to allow a full investigation on these allegations. The board was acting in the best interest of the company to ensure minimal disruptions to business operations and to protect its long-term sustainability, she said. “It is imperative that this matter be handled in a responsible manner and within the relevant statutes so as not to jeopardise the investigation. While this process is being conducted, Johannesburg Metrobus is not able to comment further at the moment pending the finalisation of the investigation,” she concluded.

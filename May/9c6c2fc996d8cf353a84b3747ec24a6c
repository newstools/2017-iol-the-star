 Earlier the flying squad fired live ammunition into the air and threw flash bangs in #eldoradopark. POPS stopped them. @ReporterStar pic.twitter.com/Ng2Rlnh4Ar  â€” Ilanit Chernick (@LanC_02) May 8"/>  Chernick explained that together with the large media contingent at the scene, she was standing with the police when she sustained the injuries. "We were with the police as some of the residents were trying to charge forward and were throwing rocks," she said. "As we were trying to take cover the rock throwing intensified and I was hit in the stomach and shoulder simultaneously." Chernick said police then opened fire with flash bangs and rubber bullets and this was when she was able to escape the altercation and run for cover. She has since been treated by the paramedics while protest action in the area continues. Meanwhile, Timothy Barnard, a photographer from The Star was also injured during the tense stand-off between residents and police and his camera has been damaged. "I was hit by a rock on my right hand and on my chest as I was trying to take a picture of the arrests." Apart from hurling rocks, residents have also burnt tyres as they tried to barricade the area as well as parts of the Golden Highway. They also removed street signs and used it to shield themselves from the rubber bullets which were fired by the police. Although arrests have been made in connection with the protests, it is still unclear how many people have been taken into custody. The number of those who were injured was also not known. The protest is ongoing.

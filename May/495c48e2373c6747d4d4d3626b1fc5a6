While waiting for the report that will determine whether free education is feasible or not, students are raising funds to assist those who cannot afford to pay. At the University of Johannesburg, students have arranged the UJ Future Walk - which is in its second year - to try to raise funds. Students will take part in a 5km walkathon and an 8km run on May 20 to raise funds. “By participating in the Future Walk, students and the surrounding community can help the university to ensure a future for our students. “UJ has already invested millions in student bursaries over the past few years. However, this investment is still not enough to assist all our students.  The funds raised from the UJ Future Walk will go a long way in ensuring this does not happen again,” said Nolwazi Mamorare, Executive Director: Financial Governance and Revenue at UJ. In 2016, the university’s Missing Middle campaign secured over R100m through which the university, working with the UJ Student Representative Council, were able to assist over 3000 students by paying their registration fees and minimum initial payments for the 2016 academic year. The Future Walk will take place at  the  AW Muller Stadium at the Bunting Road campus. Meanwhile, Wits aims to raise funds through an SMS campaign #Imfundo Campaign, SRC head of fundraising Lindokuhle Ntumba said. “This great initiative is meant to assist and change many students’ lives.” To donate, people can text “Imfundo” to 42167.  The transaction costs R30.

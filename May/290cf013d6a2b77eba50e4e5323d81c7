For people with coeliac disease, a condition that affects one percent of the population, gluten triggers a gut reaction that prevents the absorption of nutrients, causing painful symptoms including bloating, diarrhoea and nausea. Gluten-free food has become popular among people without the disease who perceive it as healthy, with global sales up 12.6% last year, compared to four percent for packaged foods overall. However, gluten consumption does not appear to increase the risk of heart disease, and abstaining from the protein can reduce intake of healthy whole grains, found the researchers. The team of 13 scientists from institutions, including Harvard and Columbia University in New York, said gluten-free diets “should not be recommended” to otherwise healthy people with the aim of preventing heart disease. “Concern has arisen in the medical community and lay public that gluten may increase the risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cardiovascular risk among healthy people,” they wrote in the British Medical Journal. “As a result, diets that limit gluten intake have gained popularity.” In the US, nearly 30% of adults claim to have cut down on or be actively avoiding foods. The researchers analysed data on more than 100000 people with no history of coronary heart disease, who completed a food questionnaire every few years from 1986 to 2010. After adjusting the results for influencing factors, they concluded there was no significant association between estimated gluten intake and the risk of developing heart disease.

Rosina Mosiuoa, mother of five-year-old Tinyiko Mongwe, who was brutally murdered two weeks ago in an alleged satanic plot, was yesterday teary-eyed after court proceedings at the Orlando Magistrate’s Court in Soweto. Aaron Shiburi, 21, made a brief appearance on a charge of murder after he allegedly stabbed Tinyiko multiple times before drinking his blood. Magistrate Mohamed Jooma postponed the matter to May 18 to allow the State to obtain a medical report from Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital. State prosecutor Mxolisi Nhlanyisi told the court the State intended submitting an application for the accused to be admitted to a psychiatric ward for observation. The accused was admitted to hospital after he was allegedly attacked by residents in the area following Tinyiko’s murder. Shortly after court proceedings, Mosiuoa told the media it was difficult to come to terms with her son’s death. “When I see him (Shiburi)
I don’t feel right. I don’t think
I will recover from the death of my son, but we will see what happens on May 18,” she said. Asked how she and her husband have been coping, Mosiuoa said: “It’s hard to heal, I can’t even sleep at night. Tinyiko was my only son among two girls. “He is always in my heart and I see him everywhere. I even collapsed last night because I thought I saw him. “I want the accused to stay in prison for the rest of his life for him to feel the same pain that my family are feeling now. He might come back for my two other kids. His parents must also feel the same pain that we have felt.” Tinyiko’s father, Eddie, said he would no longer be attending court proceedings as they had a negative impact on him. “My spirit is low. I don’t think I will be able to continue.”

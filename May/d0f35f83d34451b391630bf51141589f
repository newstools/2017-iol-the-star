Mayor Patricia de Lille led an interfaith prayer session on Table Mountain yesterday, attended by religious leaders from various faith communities. De Lille said the province was facing the worst drought in 100 years. "I have called for prayers today and asked our religious leaders to guide us and their congregants to pray for rain,” she said. Western Cape Premier Helen Zille declared the Western Cape a disaster area earlier in the week. Dam levels stood at 20.7%, with the last 10% of the dam water being unusable. Among the religious leaders who conducted a special prayer for rain was Rabbi Greg Alexander of the Jewish community. He also organised a rain dance. SA Human Rights Commission member Chris Nissen said everyone had a responsibility that came with the right to water. “I am calling on all religious leaders to tell your congregants to please use water responsibly,” he said. Water and waste services mayoral committee member Xanthea Limberg said the city was keeping an eye on water-wasters. "We need every resident to save water as a matter of urgency.” Level 4 restrictions are due to be implemented next week.

From House music to Afrikaans tunes and golden oldies, organisers insist there will be something for everyone at the Pretoria event on Saturday. “Jacaranda Day is one of the biggest music concert highlights on Gauteng’s event calendar,” Jacaranda FM general manager Kevin Fine said. He added it was part of Jacaranda FM’s promise to bring people more music they love. Among those heating up the Monument amphitheatre from 11am until 7pm will be Matthew Mole, Shekhinah, Mango Groove, Karen Zoid and Francois van Coke, Martin Bester, Dr Victor, Riana Nel and DJ Kent. The local talent who will headline the concert will be joined by Jacaranda presenters. The musical spectacle, in its sixth year, is acclaimed for bringing music lovers together. “Each year, people flock in their thousands to Jacaranda Day,” said Fine. “This year features another A-list line-up and will definitely be one for the books.” He added the concert was suitable for all ages and all were invited to attend. “It’s a full day of top tunes for the whole family to enjoy,” said Fine. Mango Groove’s Claire Johnston said the entire group of performers were “seriously excited” about the event. Shekhinah said: “I am super-stoked to be performing at Jacaranda Day. I’m so ready to rock that stage and feed off the love.” Van Coke added he was looking forward to his first performance at the event, and Dr Victor urged people to buy tickets.

Nonhlanhla Mdluli started Every Girl Has A Dream to help young women turn their dreams into reality and last week launched the organisation’s annual seminar in Pretoria. The organisation facilitates “fun positive mentoring programmes” for young women and invites accomplished women to come and share their stories with them. It was established in 2015 and they have had 10 seminars. The organisation has had over 30 speakers over the years , and has touched the lives of over a 1000 young women. “We encourage their ambition and empower their confidence, but most of all, the mentees and mentors in our programme have shown the power of sisterhood, community and self-love,” said Mdluli. She added that the organisation was a place where everyone could come together not by gossip or pulling each other down, but in “sisterhood, empowerment and fun”. The organisation has six ambassadors “dedicated in reaching out and giving out the power of sisterhood”. Some are entrepreneurs, authors, motivational speakers and chief executives of their own businesses. Thembi Mkhwanazi, who had been part of the organisation for some time, said it played a major role in her life and helped her achieve her dreams. “I am a proud ambassador of EGHAD because it has helped so many girls in a short period,” said Mkhwanazi. Eve Bodirwa, a singer and an ambassador for EGHAD, met Mdluli on Instagram and started attending the seminars. In 2016, the organisation hosted a competition, “Hold On Experience”. Bodirwa auditioned and won, and later recorded a song with the likes of Siphokazi Mohapi and Thapelo Lekoane, produced by Ziyon from the hit duo Liquideep. She performed her song on Gospel Classics on SABC 2. “It was an honour to work with such amazing people, I still get support from the organisation and Mdluli, my mentor and vocal coach,” said Bodirwa.

They are aged 40, 33 and 14, and are among the 17 cases of measles in Gauteng, with the remainder in Joburg and Ekurhuleni. There were 11 cases over the past year in Gauteng - 10 linked to one family which refused vaccination for religious reasons. Provincial Health Department spokesperson Khutso Rabothata said a measles immunisation campaign had been rolled out across the city since the 24-day drive got under way last Tuesday. MEC for Health Dr Gwen Ramokgopa said on Sunday that the department aimed to vaccinate around a million children between the ages of six months and five years across the province. “Since the Joburg region is the centre of the outbreak, we are extending the target group to be vaccinated to 15 years of age,” she said. Ramokgopa said the month of June would be used for a
mop-up campaign. Immunisation centres have been set up in all public health facilities, which include clinics, community health centres and hospitals. “Parental consent will be required for children to be vaccinated in crèches and schools,” she said. Ramokgopa said the department was aware that every three to four years there was a need to have a national campaign against measles. “The reason is that there is a gradual build-up of 'susceptibles' to the measles disease. The measles vaccine can guarantee around 95% immunity to the population. That means there will be around 5% of the immunised population that can get the disease,” she said. She said the 5% of susceptibles continued to add up over the years, building up to a large number of people who could easily contract the disease. “That is why there is a need to have a nationwide campaign to vaccinate all children against the disease,” Ramokgopa said.

A board of inquiry recommended that the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority sack him and that the police investigate him. Chidziya was suspended on full pay two years ago. The horns were kept in safe storage and many of them had been taken from poachers. Trade in rhino horn is prohibited in Zimbabwe. Environment Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri confirmed she had received the report from the inquiry. ZimParks board chair Tichafa Mundangepfupfu told Harare's Sunday Mail newspaper: “The issue of missing rhino horns is before the ZRP’s department of economic crimes unit, and we are expecting to go to court soon. "On the issue of maladministration, we brought (Chidziya) before a disciplinary hearing and he was found guilty; that's why he was dismissed. "In fact, we are in the process of hunting for a new director-general.” ZimParks had 4 303 rhino horns at its headquarters in 2011. In 2015, officials discovered that 56 horns were missing. Most of Zimbabwe's rhinos have been poached from nearly all wildlife areas, and there is only one safe zone for them, in southern Zimbabwe, in a privately owned game conservancy. - Foreign Service

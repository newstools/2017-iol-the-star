As a result, he did not appear at the Springs Magistrateâ€™s Court yesterday. Police said they could not link him to the crime but were still investigating whether he was part of the syndicate. However, five people appeared in court and were charged with human trafficking and living off the proceeds of prostitution. This comes after a group of 17 people were arrested on Thursday when police raided a brothel in Springs. The group consisted of 11 women in their early twenties and six men between 19 and 42. However, only four women and a man were charged with human trafficking under the Sexual Offences Act in court yesterday. The matter was postponed to June 6 to allow police to verify if the accused have any pending cases against them or previous convictions, and also to verify the asylum status of the man, who is a foreign national. The five were also expected to apply for bail on June 6. They were arrested after a woman ran away and tipped police off about an alleged brothel on Thursday night. Police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele yesterday told The Star that the other 12, including the actor, who were arrested were not placed on the court roll.

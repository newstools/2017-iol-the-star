One by one, speakers spoke of her excellent command of the English language and her admirable general knowledge. The service took place at Clapham High School in Pretoria yesterday and was well attended. The hall was packed with close friends, pupils and family. The 67-year-old Mphahlele died at the school on Tuesday. She complained of a tight chest and then collapsed. She had been supervising an exam. She had retired and returned to assist with Grade 8 to 12 English classes at the beginning of March as the school had a vacancy. On Tuesday morning soon after school started, Mphahlele went out of the classroom and headed to the staff room, saying she was not feeling well. There she collapsed and was assisted by a team of teachers, who worked hard to try to resuscitate her. Family representative Landiwe Tladi described her late friend as a “walking encyclopedia”. When they were younger, they would always consult her. “While we didn’t read that much, we always knew Flo had the answers,” said a teary Tladi. “She always said she found solace in books.” School headmaster Henning Pieters said Mphahlele possessed a vast amount of knowledge. “It was always such bliss talking to her. Rest assured, I always walked away with some form of new knowledge every time.” Pieters said that at times, he was intimidated when initiating conversations with Mphahlele because of her demeanour and eloquence. “You had to watch what you said and how well you said it. “She possessed so much elegance and class in her persona,” said Pieters. “Her death came as a shock.” Mphahlele will be buried tomorrow, after a service at the school at 7am.

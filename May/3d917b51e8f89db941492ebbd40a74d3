Cape Town – Chaos broke out at the joint meeting of the finance and trade and industry committees on Wednesday between chairperson of the finance committee Yunus Carrim and leader of the Black First Land First Andile Mngxitama. Carrim and Mngxitama almost traded blows over the latter’s refusal to leave the Chamber for calling chairperson of the trade and industry committee Joanne Fubbs a fascist. The BLF was in Parliament to make a presentation on the transformation of the financial sector. Mngxitama called for the destruction of white monopoly capital. He accused the ANC of not backing President Jacob Zuma in his call for the expropriation of land without compensation. However, he refused to answer Carrim on the illicit financial flows and that billions of rand leave the country illegally. Later Carrim told Mngxitama he took exception for calling Fubbs “a fascist”, and asked him to leave the Chamber, but he refused. Carrim then confronted Mngxitama and heated exchanges ensued and the two men almost came to blows. Some of the MPs stood up and separated the two men, and the police were called in. Mngxitama and some of his supporters left the meeting. Political Bureau

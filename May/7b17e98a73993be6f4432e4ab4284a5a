It's believed the alleged boss of the Sexy Boys and 26s gangs took a wrong turn and was targeted by a rival gang. "Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident at about 7.15pm in 40th Street, Eureka Estate, Ravensmead where a 52-year-old man was injured are under investigation," police spokesperson FC van Wyk said. "An attempted murder case was opened for investigation. Investigations continue."  Members of his gangs have reportedly been dispatched to guard him at the hospital, while other teams have been deployed too retaliate. A local neighbourhood watch member in Ravensmead said the shooting continued late into Monday night. There were more shootings earlier on Monday in the same area, but the police could not confirm if the shootings were linked. "Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident this afternoon in 47th Street, Connaught Estate, Ravensmead where a 51-year-old man was fatally wounded and three others age 43 and 49 injured are under investigation. A murder and attempted murder case was registered for investigation," Van Wyk said.

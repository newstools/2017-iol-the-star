The musical event was a fun day out for families and friends, who danced and sang along to songs by their favourite artists. They were treated to a star-studded performance by among others Matthew Mole, Shekhinah, Mango Groove, Karen Zoid, François van Coke, Martin Bester, Dr Victor, Riana Nel and DJ Kent. Fans were also thrilled to see their favourite Jacaranda FM presenters in person. The event started at 11am and went on until 7pm. It was presented by Jacaranda FM and Gumtree. Station general manager Kevin Fine said: “Seeing great South Africans singing along to great music, enjoying the atmosphere together makes you want to do more and more of these things.” Some revellers travelled from Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North West. Fine said the event presented an opportunity for Jacaranda to showcase a lot of South African music talents.

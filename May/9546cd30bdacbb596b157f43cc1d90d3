Between December 2015 and August 2016, 53 children were reported missing in the Western Cape, of whom 48 were found. The province with the second highest number of children reported missing is Gauteng. The report revealed that 59.8% of missing cases were for unknown reasons; 36.5% were runaways; 0.5% were kidnapped; 2% were as a result of parental abduction; and 0.2% were due to human trafficking. A number of children have been reported missing in the Western Cape since the start of this year -  and some have been found dead. Sasha-Lee November, who went missing two years ago at the age of six, is still to be found. She disappeared while playing outside her home in Hanover Park, and her mother, Sandra November, said she was hopeful her child would one day return. - Staff Reporter

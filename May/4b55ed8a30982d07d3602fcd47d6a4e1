Yesterday, Sasco slammed Pandor, accusing her of sabotaging their march to the higher education and training offices on Tuesday to demand free education. Sasco president Thabo Moloja claims the ANC education subcommittee, led by Pandor, told them on Monday not to go ahead with the march. He said Pandor has for months been sidelining Sasco from attending committee meetings, which is why they decided to gatecrash one on Monday. He added that Pandor told them to stop being “too radical and militant”. “We will continue to be militant as long as there is no provision for free education and there’s no transformation in our sector. We cannot stop being militant because of our alignment with the ANC,” Moloja said. He claimed senior subcommittee officials called companies that volunteered to offer Sasco transport and threatened them until they pulled out. One of the issues that Sasco wants to protest about is the formation of the new Ikusasa Financial Aid scheme aimed at assisting missing middle students. “We believe we must stop the department from privatising NSFAS. You are merely donating the student market to the vultures. We have always understood NSFAS as a gateway for attaining free education,” he said. Pandor is on a visit to Tanzania. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said: “If they have issues, they know where to find the ANC.” The students vowed their march to Pretoria would still take place. “We will put Pretoria on standstill with our call for free education,” Moloja said.

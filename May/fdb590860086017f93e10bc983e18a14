The retired soccer star has been looking at territories in the Caribbean as he thinks it would be the perfect gift so he and his wife, along with their children Brooklyn, 18, Romeo, 14, Cruz, 12, and Harper, 5, could go on holiday without being bothered. A source told Heat magazine: “David loves the idea of the family having their own A-list status symbol and has always envied Sir Richard Branson owning Necker Island. “The whole family would be able to enjoy holidays without worrying about paparazzi or fans wanting selfies.” David, who met the former Spice Girls band member when she watched him play for his former club Manchester United and went on to marry her in 1999, has set a budget of £9 million (R155m) for the purchase and has been looking at islands in the Bahamas, where Johnny Depp has a private stretch of land, and the British Virgin Islands, which is home to businessman Branson's Necker Island. The source added that Beckham wants his children involved in decisions about the island. “He likes the idea of naming the island after Harper, but I think the names for the beaches would be decided by the kids. “They’re not looking to go all Bear Grylls, they want a luxury property too. “Victoria is not a big fan of boats, but I’m sure she’d enjoy getting one to her own stretch of land. And David loves the idea of handing her the keys to her own private paradise.” - Bang Showbiz

The violence yesterday in Finetown, south of Joburg, followed unrest this week in nearby Eldorado Park and Ennerdale. Protesters in Finetown threw stones and burnt tyres. They are demanding land and housing. In separate violence, a police station in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, was torched along with two state vehicles during a community protest. Spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the incident happened on Tuesday night when community members from Phadzima village barricaded a road leading to the police station and then attacked it. “The members on duty tried to repel them by firing some shots, but were overwhelmed by the mob of about 700. The police building was completely gutted and the police vans, recently allocated to the station, were also burnt.” The protest was over the disappearance of Mavis Mabala, 25. More officers were deployed and a hunt for the perpetrators began. Six people aged 19 to 41 were arrested. More arrests were expected. - AP and ANA

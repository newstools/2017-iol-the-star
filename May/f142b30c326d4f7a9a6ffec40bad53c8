The Tshwane Central Cluster Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit has been investigating the rape case since the victim reported it last week. The victim, from Nellmapius, told the police that he had boarded a minibus taxi in Solomon Mahlangu Drive on Friday and headed for Pretoria. Inside the taxi were three young female passengers and the driver. He told the police he first noticed that something was wrong when the route going to town changed. He was ordered to sit on the front seat, and then one of the women injected him with an unknown substance. He passed out. He later woke up on a single bed. The females then allegedly forced him to drink an energy drink, before taking turns raping him numerous times. They used protection the entire time. The manâ€™s ordeal lasted for two days, and he was dropped off in an open field in Benoni on Sunday. Police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach said the man was traumatised by his ordeal and had received medical treatment. She encouraged all victims of rape to report such crimes. - Virgilatte Gwangwa

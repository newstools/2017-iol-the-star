The situation was calm as night approached, but police maintained strong visibility. This morning, human settlements MMC Mandla Nkomo and ward councillor Farouk Essop were due to meet representatives of the community to discuss their service delivery issues in a bid to resolve the impasse. Stores, mostly owned by foreign nationals, are reopening and the clearing of the rubble is under way. The unrest followed days of service delivery protests across Gauteng, starting on Monday in Eldorado Park and Freedom Park in Joburg, before Ennerdale residents joined in. Residents of the Itereleng informal settlement admitted they had throughout the years illegally connected electricity, risking their lives to ensure they had a cooked meal and kept warm in winter. But yesterday, they decided it was enough, and dramatic scenes unfolded as they voiced their frustration, closing off streets leading to the township from as early as 5am. Garbage and large rocks were scattered across the R55. Stones were thrown at vehicles that attempted to get past the impromptu roadblock. Residents said they were tired of empty promises and accused Essop of failing to provide basic services such as electricity, toilets and decent roads. “The environment where we live is unhealthy. There is no electricity, and when it rains, the roads are so bad that people can’t get in or out,” said John Mbhele, who has been living at the informal settlement for nine years. “We are struggling. There are illegal connections that burn our shacks and kill our kids. Our councillor must come and address us to tell us why there is no budget allocated to our ward. If no one comes to speak to us, we will protest until someone answers.” Residents are requesting not just electricity, but for land to enable them to build their own houses. The angry residents said there was only one tap to serve scores of households.

This is the view of the ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal, which has slammed the move by the board to discontinue the policy, introduced last year by former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Mandla Shange, ANCYL KZN spokesperson, said: “Our argument is that the 90% local content policy is an SABC policy and the board has no right to do away with it.” He said the policy served the best interests of local artists, and it had been “in that spirit” that Motsoeneng introduced it. “It is not true that listenership has been dwindling. If that is so, they (SABC board) need to show us scientific research to prove their claims. The policy promoted patriotism because it is clear that South Africans love their local artists.” Shange added that the ANCYL was planning a march to the Durban City Hall to hand a memorandum of  grievances to SABC bigwigs. A date was yet to be set. He said the league would engage soon with the SABC’s national leadership and other stakeholders, including newly appointed Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo. SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago yesterday refused to divulge the reasons for the board’s decision to cancel the policy. He rejected Shange’s assertion that the board had no business interfering in policies, because policy issues were the responsibility of the board as every policy at the SABC needed board approval. “It is not something we want to put in the public space, but when the board were appointed, they had the directive that if they feel policies have had a negative impact on the organisation, they will review it, and that is what they have done.” Kganyago added that people who wanted to engage with the public broadcaster’s interim board on its decisions should feel free to do so.

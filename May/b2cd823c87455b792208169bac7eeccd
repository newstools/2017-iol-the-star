This is after the Soshanguve man was arrested last week for allegedly plotting to murder a number of cabinet officials. Ramosebudi, 32, appeared briefly in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court yesterday. His charges were changed and the matter was postponed to Friday, when his bail application is expected to be heard. State prosecutor advocate Johan Badenhorst informed magistrate Vincent Ratshibvumo that the charge was being changed to incitement to commit murder. This is despite the NPA saying it did not have enough evidence suggesting he was plotting a coup. Soon after court proceedings, NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw said Ramosebudi’s charges had been changed based on the information at its disposal. She added that investigations would determine whether the accused is sent to a psychiatric ward for mental observation. “The proper charge that can be preferred is incitement. A conspiracy charge requires two or more people to conspire together to commit a crime. Ramosebudi acted alone,” Louw told reporters. She clarified the confusion surrounding the gravity of the charge the accused is facing. According to the Hawks, Ramosebudi was labelled a coup plotter, implying that the charges he faces would be more severe. “It’s incorrect to say they are not serious offences. The difference is that in schedule one offences, the onus is on the state to prove to the court that it's in the interest of justice to keep the accused in custody.” Louw explained that the NPA’s stance towards the accused being granted bail would be dependent on the evidence gathered during ongoing investigations. “When we have information that suggests State witnesses might be in danger if the accused is released on bail, we will oppose bail. But if we don’t have grounds to oppose bail, we will follow that route,” she said.

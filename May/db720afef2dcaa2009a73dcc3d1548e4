This arose during a briefing of the National Assembly committee on communications about the progress made on the 14 recommendations contained in the report of the ad hoc committee into the SABC. Yesterday, parliamentary senior legal adviser Anthea Gordon confirmed that an application had been lodged in the Western Cape High Court by Muthambi while she was the communications minister. Parliament’s Speaker, Baleka Mbete, was cited as a respondent, along with SABC ad hoc committee chairperson Vincent Smith. “The case is specific,” said Gordon. She said it was not aimed at the overall work of the ad hoc committee, but at recommendations relating to the minister of communications. Gordon pointed out that Muthambi’s contention was that the National Assembly, and by extension the ad hoc committee, was not competent to make recommendations against her, saying it was beyond its terms of reference. “There is a notice of motion we are attending to,” Gordon said. The report, which was supported by all parties except the UDM, called Muthambi out for “displaying incompetence in carrying out her responsibilities as a shareholder representative” at the SABC. It found that she interfered in some of the decision-making by the board and irregularly amended a memorandum of incorporation in order to centralise power in the ministry. The committee also found that Muthambi had violated provisions of laws and codes of conduct, and should be reported to the institution’s ethics committee and to President Jacob Zuma for charges. Gordon said Muthambi’s application had been signed before Zuma’s cabinet reshuffle, which saw him move Muthambi to the public service and administration portfolio. The DA’s Phumzile van Damme asked about the standing of the application, since Muthambi was no longer communications minister. Committee chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana said Gordon could not answer the question. “That is a question for the department,” he said.

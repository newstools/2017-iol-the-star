“If we sit and apply our minds calmly, it cannot be true that those two issues are the biggest problems that we have right now,” she said. The main problems that the alliance has to deal with are issues of poverty, inequality and unemployment. That is one assessment that we agree on as the alliance. That at a particular moment, some partner was angered by something is not the primary issue that divides us,” she added. Mbete said the issue of Zuma and the Guptas was raised last year within the alliance, and processes to talk about it started but were never concluded. “Perhaps we have not processed it fully. Maybe if we sit down we will go back and talk about it,” she said Mbete was speaking to The Mercury, after addressing a Cosatu march in Durban where a small section of the crowd, mainly SACP members from Inchanga, booed her and the ANC’s provincial chairperson.   But the crowd cheered former KwaZulu-Natal premier Senzo Mchunu, who lost the ANC’s KZN chairpersonship to Sihle Zikalala in a bitter battle in 2015. Mbete would not comment on disruptions at some of the rallies in other parts of the country, saying she had not received the full information on what transpired at those gatherings.

She could not say whether the disruptions were planned or spontaneous, she said. “The information we got from the people who know that section of the crowd is that those are people from Ntshanga, who still have issues about what happened in Inchanga.” Clashes between the SACP and the ANC in Inchanga have resulted in the deaths of some members. Mbete expressed concern over the ANC’s prospects in 2019, if the divisions in the alliance persist. “If we continue like this, comrades, we will never see 2019,” she had told the crowd. Mbete said there was an urgent need for the leadership of the alliance to talk and thrash out their differences. “Where there are human beings even in a family from time to time there will be differences, and you settle them and you continue with life. The only way to sort this out is for us to sit down and talk as leaders.” Asked if the divisions were fuelled by the ANC’s succession race, Mbete said there was currently no race. “The ANC officially has no campaign and does not recognise a race because it is not there officially,” she said. Mbete has been mentioned as one of the possible successors to Zuma. She was, however, evasive when asked whether she will stand for any position. “I will give that answer when the time comes. There will come a time and at that point you must ask that question.” She refused to say whether any ANC structures had approached her on possibly running for a position. She was hopeful that the alliance partners can still find one another on most of the contentious issues. “We do not want a splinter party. We are concerned, but we think the ANC has it within itself to engage on those issues.” The Mercury

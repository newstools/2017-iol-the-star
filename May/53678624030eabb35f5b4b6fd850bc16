The pageant’s annual Cansa gala dinner was held at Emperors Palace at the weekend and saw the most inspiring "superwomen" take the next step closer to the crown. MC for the night was former Miss South Africa, businesswoman Jo-Ann Strauss. Entertainment was provided by House sensation Tamara Dey and Garth Taylor. The top 100 finalists got the chance to show why they deserved to be in the top 25 after months of workshops, networking and judging sessions. “Mrs South Africa is a woman empowerment programme first and foremost, and we are excited about the positive ripple effect it has created in South Africa,” said chief executive Joani Johnson. She said the pageant was not a typical beauty competition, and offered women who have real-life careers, families and hobbies a platform to make a difference. “The women we work with all have those real relatable stories we are looking for, 
and this movement is about giving unsung superwomen a chance to get support and give input, and an opportunity to reach a new level of success and visibility on a global stage,” she said. The judging panel included former Miss South Africa Thuli Sithole, Vusi Zwane, Unaiza Mooideen and, as principal judge, former Miss SA Cindy Nell-Roberts. Johnson also announced the reveal of the new branding for the pageant. “We felt the need to restructure our brand in such a way as to showcase the virtues of South Africa, the spirit of ubuntu, and the real, relatable women that we work with.” She said the new brand did away with the ideals that did not match real women, and instead showcased "true beauty that shines from within". “We are celebrating every woman in her unique femininity,” she said. The finale and crowning of the new Mrs South Africa will take place in October. @mane_mpi

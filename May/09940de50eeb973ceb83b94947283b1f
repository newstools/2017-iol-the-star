Du Toit, the brother of murdered Teresa van Breda, said he had received a phone call from the estate manager at De Zalze Estate in Stellenbosch to go to the Van Breda residence on January 27, 2015, but he was not told why. On arrival, Du Toit saw police vehicles and realised something was seriously wrong. After introducing himself to the police, he was informed that Henri had been taken to the police station. Henri’s 16-year-old sister Marli had been transported to the Stellenbosch MediClinic, Du Toit testified. Recalling the moments when he was informed of the news of the murders of Martin, Teresa and Rudi van Breda, as well as the attempted murder of Marli, Du Toit started trembling and was overcome with emotion. He refused the offer to sit down after being informed that he could do so if he wished. When Du Toit and his wife Sonja, who had joined him at the house, left to see his niece in hospital, they were told by doctors that she was being transferred to the Vergelegen MediClinic, where doctors were better able to assist her. The couple left the hospital and headed to the police station in Stellenbosch, but were not allowed to see Henri. They later found out that he was not at the police station but at the detectives’ offices. Du Toit said he saw Henri later at the house of Marli’s then boyfriend, James Reade-Jahn. Their encounter was very emotional. “We didn’t talk much as Henri stutters when he talks fast, so he spoke slowly to explain,” he told the court. The trial continues. - ANA

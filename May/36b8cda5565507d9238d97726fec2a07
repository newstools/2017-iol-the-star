Shoprite spokesperson Sarita van Wyk confirmed the tense situation had ended without loss of life and was grateful to police for their handling of the incident. “Five supermarket employees, three contracted security personnel and two employees from the contracted cleaning company were held hostage by the armed men inside the store for almost 12 hours before they were freed by the SAPS shortly before 18:00 tonight (on Monday night). The supermarket chain is concerned for their employees and contractors’ emotional well-being and will support them with whatever they require to recover from this terrible ordeal.” She said one of the robbers was injured during the shooting has been found by the police, while a search in the store for the rest of the perpetrators was conducted. “Following a stand-off that lasted hours, members of the Special Task Force managed to take out 11 people from the Mall in Manenberg. SAPS experts, comprising of hostage negotiators, Task Force members, National Intervention Unit and detectives descended on the premises early this morning (on Monday) following an attempted armed robbery,” said police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana.        Rwexana said police were combing the building in search of any other people and the investigation continues. The Deputy Minister of Police Bongani Mkongi also visited the scene in efforts to bring the situation under control. Mkongi had released a statement after Monday’s brazen robbery in Delft where robbers shot two guards, opened fire on police and escaped with an undisclosed amount. “It is our commitment to intensify police visibility in all critical areas such as malls, shopping complexes and ATMs in order to minimise robberies and heists. Our commitment in dealing with criminals in a ‘lean and mean’ fashion is starting to bear fruits and we are going to continue to heighten our efforts towards greater efficiency and effectiveness.” TSU Protection Services Operations manager Corne Vermeulen confirmed their staff were first on the scene. “We provide security for Shoprite Group retails store in certain areas and our team arrived in time as the suspects attempted to rob, what we believe was the Sassa grants money. Shots were exchanged and one of our members was wounded in his left arm and leg and was in surgery at a nearby hospital.” He said the guard was still in surgery and was not sure as to his condition. A Sherwood Park resident requesting their name be withheld, said he heard the shots fired in the morning. “This was an automatic gunfire and not a handgun, we came outside and saw the security shooting at about five or six men. I cannot tell you how many shots were fired, but it continued for a while and police arrived long after the security and one person was shot.” Cape Times

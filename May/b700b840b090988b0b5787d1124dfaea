Johannesburg - Hundreds of mourners gathered at the Protea Multipurpose center to bid farewell to local DJ and former Generations actor Mandla Hlatshwayo. In an unconventional way to start a funeral, family and friends danced to celebrate to sounds of Hlatshwayo, who was a well known community radio disc jockey. According to Mpho Tsedu, the social scene in Soweto had lost a great man. He asked the congregation: "How do we repay him?" "Killed in a cold blooded murder ... I refuse to share my space with these criminals who killed Mandla. My appeal to the government is that his blood should be a trigger to do something," said Tsedu a close friend to Hlatshwayo. Four suspects appeared on Thursday in the Lenasia Magistrateâ€™s Court, where they were charged with two counts of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and dealing in drugs. The case was postponed to next week for legal representation to be found. Family and friends shared their fondest memories with Hlatshwayo, although many say they are still in denial about his untimely death. "I thought it was a prank when I saw his body lying cold without shoes. Those thugs took his shoes," said Jozi FM Mpho Mhlongo. "How long will we do nothing?" asked Mhlongo. Hlatshwayo is considered a hero for the bravery he showed in his final hours. The service is currently underway. IOL

Johannesburg – Limpopo police are celebrating a victory in the fight against crime affecting protected species, following the arrest of three men selling Pangolins. Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said a new trend has emerged of hunting the Pangolins and other protected species. "The suspects were arrested in Tzaneen for the possession of a protected species (Pangolin)," he said. The three men were identified as Simba Simango, Jacob Thosago, and Chipo Maphosa – all between the ages of 19 and 32. "It is alleged that members of the K9 Unit received information that there are three people selling a Pangolin at the Lifestyle Mall. Members reacted swiftly and arrested the suspects. During the arrest, a living Pangolin was found inside the car and it was confiscated," Ngoepe explained. The suspects appeared on Tuesday before the Tzaneen Magistrate Court where they were all denied bail and their case was remanded to May 19 for a formal bail application. Police investigations are still continuing. @lanc_02  ilanit.chernick@inl.co.za  The Star

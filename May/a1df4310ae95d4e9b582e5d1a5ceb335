Five years after hosting the launch of the playhouse, actor Sello Maake ka Ncube has returned to his hometown for a solo performance as the man behind one of the greatest South African short stories, The Suit, in the play House of Truth. Last week, the opening night was attended by many actors and entertainers. Old familiar faces, including Leroy Gopal and Pamela Nomvete, were in attendance. The Queen stars Sthembiso Khoza and Vuyo Ngcukana, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, Mpho Osei-Tutu and Thato Molamu were also in Soweto to show support. Maake ka Ncube said it was Themba who inspired him to continue acting when all he wanted to do was quit. “He revived my career. If it were not for him, I would not be the actor I am today. I urge people to come see this show.” His portrayal of Themba shows the complex life he had during his troubles with the Transvaal Department of Education, which refused to recognise him as a qualified teacher, despite the fact that he held a degree. The play also explores Themba’s journalism journey at Drum magazine as part of the “Drum Boys”. The performance takes place on a stage set up as a single room flat in 1950s Sophiatown. House of Truth is written by Siphiwo Mahala and directed by theatre legend Vanessa Cooke. “I’m back where it all started for me, in Soweto,” said Maake ka Ncube. The play premiered at the National Arts Festival last year and ran at the Market Theatre earlier this year. A sign-language interpreter has been added to the play on two Sunday shows to make it accessible to the deaf. This year marks 50 years since Themba’s passing. The play runs until Sunday, May 21, and tickets to the show start at R120.

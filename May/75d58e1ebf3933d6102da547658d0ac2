DURBAN – The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks board will close several beaches along Durban in anticipation of large swells that are expected to hit on Thursday night. Mike Anderson-Reade, Head of Operations at the board said they had been monitoring the progress of a very strong southwesterly system that is due to arrive off the KZN coastline. “The system is expected to produce a strong southerly groundswell and fresh south westerly winds for a period of three to possibly four days. Large swells and very unsettled seas may result in movement and damage to shark safety gear. In order to minimise damage or losses the Sharks Board, in consultation with the affected Municipalities, has removed shark safety gear at a number of bathing beaches this morning ahead of the unsettled weather,” he said. Anderson-Reade said beaches will be closed for bathing during this period and shark safety gear will be reinstalled as soon as conditions settle early next week. Daily News

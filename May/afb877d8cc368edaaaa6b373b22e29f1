Johannesburg - Four foreign nationals were arrested on Tuesday night in Diepsloot and Cosmo City following several operations conducted by the SA Police Services (SAPS) Robbery Reaction Team. According to Gauteng police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, three Somalis and a Malawian were apprehended for possession of unlicensed firearms and goods believed to have been stolen during several armed business robberies. “The team responded on information from members of the community and proceeded to search a shop in Diepsloot and a house in Cosmo City." “During a search in Diepsloot, police seized a firearm suspected to have been stolen from a police officer in Olievenhoutbosch during 2012,” he said. “Three Somali nationals were arrested and are still being questioned as to how they came into possession of such a firearm." “This may lead to the arrest of more suspects involved in the robbery of such a firearm from a police officer,” Dlamini explained. In a separate incident in Cosmo City, Dlamini said police had responded to several reports of “suspicious people” living in a residential home in the area who had been acting in “suspicious manner”. “On searching the premises, police seized a fake platinum bar, watches, laptops, a pistol with 25 rounds of ammunition." “A Malawian national and his girlfriend were arrested at the scene,” he said. Dlamini warned that there will be a quick response for any information on suspicious people and vehicles as police are continuing to intensify operations and deploy more members to deal with business robberies, house robberies and vehicle hijackings. “Members of the public must continue to isolate criminals and are encouraged to report any suspicious activity to 10111 at all hours,” Dlamini added.  ilanit.chernick@inl.co.za  @Lanc_02 The Star

Now a 38-year-old man, who rented a room in Courtney’s family home, has been fingered as the prime suspect in her death and disappearance. He has gone on the run since her body was discovered at Bofors Circle in Epping Industria. Yesterday, the police’s K9 unit descended on the house in Pluto Road, seeking clues to the disappearance and death of the three-year-old girl. Pluto Road was cordoned off. Manenberg Crisis Forum chairperson Roegshanda Pascoe, who supported the family over the weekend ahead of a scheduled wreath-laying ceremony at the scene where she was found, said the home was possibly a crime scene. Courtney’s mother had the harrowing task, on Mother’s Day, of identifying her child’s body at Tygerberg mortuary. A 200-strong search party had gathered in Elsies River on Saturday morning in hopes of finding the girl, who went missing on May 4, but a team from Delft, who helped in the search, made the shocking discovery when they saw a foot protruding from the sand. “After finding her body, the scene was cordoned off and the parents were advised not to go to the scene. Her body was not decomposed,” Pascoe said. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk confirmed the investigation was ongoing. He refused to be drawn into speculation around the circumstances of Courtney’s death. Elsies River Community Police Forum deputy chairperson Imraahn Mukaddam said they were saddened by the death.

People worldwide took to various social media such as Twitter and Facebook to complain about the shutdown. Some of us even found ourselves going back aeons in to the past to SMS, *gasp*.  However, WhatsApp is back up after suffering an outage that affected users around the world for hours. The Facebook-owned messaging service confirmed in a media statement that it had been inaccessible, but did not say why. “Earlier today, WhatsApp users in all parts of the world were unable to access WhatsApp for a few hours. We have now fixed the issue and apologize for the inconvenience,” said a WhatsApp spokesperson in an email.

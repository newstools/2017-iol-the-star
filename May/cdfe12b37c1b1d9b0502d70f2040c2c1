South Africa may be home to plenty of bartenders who can shake up cocktail masterpieces, but only one can claim the ultimate title of “South African Diageo World Class Bartender of the Year 2017” and that is Julian Short. As the winner, Julian will go on to compete against the best in the world, representing South Africa where bartenders from more than 60 countries will be on a victory quest for the ultimate, World Class Bartender title in Mexico later this year.  We asked him to share with us a cocktail that's perfect for winter.  The Old Fashioned PICTURE: Samantha Slabbert The Old Fashioned is the perfect winter cocktail for any whiskey lover because this drink is all about the whiskey itself and is rather simple to prepare at home. A favourite of Mad Men's Don Draper, it has become the drink that separates the men from the boys (the women from the girls, too). So for the colder nights, try an Old Fashioned from the best mixologist in the land.  50ml of your desired whiskey (I recommend either Bulleit Bourbon or Johnnie Walker Gold Label) 10ml Brown simple syrup 1:1 (I also recommend maple syrup) 2 dashes of bitters (I recommend Angostura)  Add all ingredients into a large glass with ice and stir for 40 seconds. Pour cocktail into a tumbler, add ice and garnish with an orange zest.

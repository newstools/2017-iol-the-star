The police officer, who is believed to be a senior officer at Ijeshatedo divisional police headquarters, allegedly shot and killed Ayoade on Sunday evening. Two people were injured. Ayoade had gone to the area to attend a friend’s birthday party. The officer and his men had stormed the venue of the birthday party in two patrol vans at about 6:30 pm but left after observation. “Some minutes later, the officer and his men came back to the venue and one of the policemen shot sporadically into the air. The officer alighted from the vehicle, went straight to where Ayoade was sitting close to his girlfriend and shot him in the head at close range,” said an attendee. Attendees and residents of the street were shocked by the gruesome murder. State police commissioner Fatai Owoseni said he had yet to be briefed on the incident. “I am just coming back from a trip. I have not been briefed on the matter. I am not aware of it yet,” he said. ANA-NAN

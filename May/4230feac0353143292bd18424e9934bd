Different chefs will be sharing cooking tips in the several kitchen zones that include Pork 360, Lamb and Mutton SA and the Beef Zone. The three-day festival will have seven chefs in attendance, preparing and giving demonstrations on how best to prepare traditional and modern dishes. “Visitors to this year's festival will be treated to interesting yet simple ways to create new recipes using various cuts of lamb, beef and pork - including the increasingly popular offal cuts - over an open flame,” said kitchen zone co-ordinator chef Arnold Tanzer. Gourmet Gurus' Richard Rust, a British-born chef who's cooked for the British royal family, will show how local produce can be used for classic meals with a modern twist at the Pork 360 kitchen. He'll work alongside chef Sizwe Cebekhulu, who's been in the industry for 10 years, working in 5-star restaurants, and Kabelo Segone, the South African Chefs Association director and brand ambassador for Lucky Star. In the Lamb and Mutton SA kitchen, chef Citrum Khumalo, who is the president of African Chefs United and cooked for Nelson Mandela and Brad Pitt, will be doing the honours. He launched a range of African spices, Chef Khumalo’s Africa in a Bottle, which are sold internationally, and will be cooking lamb koftas, lamb kidneys, mutton loin and rump alongside chef Stefano Strafella, who has been in the game for 30 years. Raynor Damons and Sasha Zambetti will focus on everything beef in the Beef Zone and The Blue Ribbon Sandwich Square Theatre will allow visitors to get tips on how to make the most amazing sandwiches using different meats. The  festival takes place at the Ticketpro Dome from Friday to Sunday. Doors open at 10am and tickets can be obtained from TicketPro. - Staff Reporter

The Sascoc board decided to appoint an independent panel on Monday to look into the allegations. Sam responded in a brief text message that “a panel of independent labour lawyers will listen to both parties and advise the Sascoc board on any further action”. This follows allegations of sexual harassment and intimidation that a Sascoc staff member laid against Reddy. On Monday, a forged letter was sent to the media from the complainant’s computer stating the allegations against Reddy were false and were orchestrated by Sam and Sascoc board member Kobus Marais. “I hereby apologise for all allegations made against Sascoc CEO Tubby Reddy, and defamation to his character as I was pressurised by Sascoc president Gideon Sam together with another board member who is involved, namely Kobus Marais,” the letter stated. It later emerged that the complainant’s computer had been hacked. A copy of the complaints against Reddy was attached to the email, which included allegations of harassment and intimidation. The forged letter seems to be an attempt to clear Reddy of any wrongdoing, while claiming the complainant was coaxed into laying the complaint. “Tubby is a very humble man, gives everything to sport and does not even have the support from his president and other members of the Sascoc board,” the forgery stated. “I wish to apologise sincerely to Tubby and his family for putting them through this senseless and unnecessary hurt and smear campaign.”

The police portfolio committee chairperson François Beukman said yesterday he did not rule out MPs raising the issue with Mbalula during tomorrow’s proceedings. But, officially, the fight between the two is set to be discussed only on June 6 - at a portfolio committee meeting set to be attended by Mbalula. Beukman said tomorrow’s debate will look at the budget of the police and the allocation of resources. McBride and Phahlane were involved in a no-holds barred fight in Parliament a fortnight ago. McBride had complained about Phahlane’s interference in investigations against him. But the police chief denied the Ipid claims of interference and said he did not appoint himself to the position and was not there by force. Phahlane also denied that he had set up a unit from the North West to harass Ipid officials investigating him for corruption. Beukman said they have asked both Ipid and the SAPS to submit further documents to the committee. He said apart from the documents they wanted within 10 working days from the two SAPS bodies, Mbalula has been asked to appear before MPs. He said they have agreed the meeting with Mbalula will take place on June 6. The committee asked Mbalula to intervene in the spat between Phahlane and McBride. Phahlane accused Ipid of working with private investigator Paul O’Sullivan. The acting police commissioner also accused Ipid of raiding his house with O’Sullivan and questioning his minor daughter. But McBride has denied any wrongdoing.

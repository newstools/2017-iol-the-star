Not only will those who attend have access to these exquisite fine wines, some
of which are no longer available in the general marketplace, but they will be available for sale to festival-goers at a 10% discount on retail prices. Organiser Corlien Morris said choosing what wines will be available for tasting is essential in ensuring that only the best are shown at the festival. “This is a targeted wine experience that focuses on the flavours and nuances of these two famous Burgundian varietals,” she said. She added that generally many high-end, award-winning Pinot Noir and Chardonnay wines are not shown at other festivals because they are often too expensive and have too small a production. “People who come to the Chardonnay and Pinot Noir Festival are generally passionate and knowledgeable about wine and are interested in these varietals. “We are delighted with the fine wines we are presenting this year.” The exclusive group of wine lovers attending the event will have the chance to savour more than 70 of South Africa’s best Chardonnays and Pinot Noirs as well as these wine varietals from France, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina. There are more than 20 new South African wines on show this year, including the five-star Platter-winning Chamonix Chardonnay 2015 and Chamonix Reserve Chardonnay 2015. Other featured five-star Platter wines are the Groot Constantia Chardonnay 2015, Haskell Anvil Chardonnay 2015, Hamilton Russell Vineyards Chardonnay 2016, Hamilton Russell Vineyards Pinot Noir 2016 and the Jordan Barrel Fermented Chardonnay 2016. Other newcomers include: B Vintners Black Bream Pinot Noir 2016, Broad Valley Pinot Noir 2014, Crystallum Mabalel Pinot Noir 2016, Ghost Corner Pinot Noir 2015, Haskell Dombeya Chardonnay 2015, Highlands Road Pinot Noir 2012, La Brune Pinot Noir 2015 and Laarman Cluster Series Chardonnay 2016. New international wines on show are the French Domaine Lorenzon Champs Martin Pinot Noir 2014, Gerard Bertrand Chardonnay Reserve Speciale 2015, Gerard Bertrand Pinot Noir Reserve Speciale 2014, J. Moreau et Fils Chablis 2014, J. Moreau et Fils Pinot Noir 2014, Louis Latour Chablis 2014 and the Longavi Pinot Noir 2014 from Chile.

The CWU and National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union were the first to warn President Jacob Zuma not to address Cosatu’s Workers’ Day rally in Bloemfontein, where Zuma was booed. The warning comes a few days after Cosatu’s top brass announced the decision to bar Zuma from attending and addressing any of its events. General secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said some leaders of the federation felt that allowing Zuma to speak was inconsistent with calls made by Cosatu, the SACP, opposition parties and civil society for him to step down. CWU general secretary Aubrey Tshabalala said although the central committee was needed to deal with the “crisis within the ANC”, it should be used to look into the contentious issue of labour brokers. Meanwhile, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said on Thursday that the ruling party was yet to meet with Cosatu. We will be meeting for the first time since the May Day activities. We have all agreed that we need to meet soon,” he said. The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) and SA Democratic Teachers Union said worker issues must be the central committee’s priority. Popcru general secretary Nkosinathi Theledi said the central committee had to strengthen the federation. He further said they were not threatened by the increasing formation of independent unions and organisations. Political Bureau

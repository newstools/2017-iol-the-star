Johannesburg – Hundreds of ANC members from the Northern Cape descended at Luthuli House on Tuesday afternoon demanding to meet with the ANC top six. The Northern Cape ANC Provincial Elective Conference (PEC) is set to take place on Thursday but it seems as though some members are planning to boycott the conference. Members of the ZF Mgcawu District Municipality (ZFM), John Taolo Gaetsewe District Municipality (JTG), Namaqualand and Frances Baard regions ANC picketed outside the ANC headquarters, demanding to speak to the top six. “We have exhausted all internal avenues hence Luthuli House is our only hope.

ANC member Reginald Alexander said they did not want the conference to take place as there were many disputes that had not been attended to. "These disputes are lying on the Secretary General's table. We are coming here to tell the top six to attend to our disputes." "Among the disputes are the excluding of members to participate in the BGM (Branch General meeting) meetings prior to the conference.We are supposed to have a quorum to constitute such a meeting," said Alexander. "There are those supporting comrade Zamani Saul (current secretary general) to be the chairperson and the other group supporting comrade Sylvia Lucas, (current provincial treasurer and premier of Northern Cape) to be the chairperson," he said. Alexander said the Frances Baard members were for the women empowerment thus their support for Sylvia Lucas. . Another dispute was the alleged cloning of conference delegates resulting in ZFM and other regions resulting in more delegates attending it. @Zwane_2li2ls The Star

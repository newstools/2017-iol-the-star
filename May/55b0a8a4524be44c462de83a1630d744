Hosted by comedian Tumi Morake and choreographer Somizi Mhlongo, rapper Kwesta and Afro-pop vocalist Amanda Black dominated the night, winning four trophies each at the ceremony. Kwesta picked up awards for the coveted Best Male Artist of the Year, Best Rap Album, Highest Airplay and Best Collaboration. Black won Best Newcomer, Best Female Artist, Best R&B/Soul/Reggae Album and Best Album. These wins all come on the strength of her debut album, Amazulu. Nasty C, who was the most-nominated artist with five nominations, disappointingly walked away empty handed. This came after his controversial domination of the Metros and his disqualification from the category of best video due to late entry. Black Motion walked away with awards for Best Duo/Group and Best Dance Album. Dr Malinga won Best Kwaito Album, Vusi Nova was awarded Best Afro-pop Album and GoodLuck walked away with the gong for Best Pop Album. Hip hop royalty Khuli Chana, Kwesta and Stogie T performed at the awards.

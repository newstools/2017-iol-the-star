 Edwina Presence, 37, was abducted on Saturday, 29 April when she travelled on the Cape Town to Bellville route. After an horrific ordeal, in which she played dead in order to survive, the mother of five was found two days later, battered and bruised in Paarl Hospital. On Monday, about 10 drivers who work the Cape Town-Bellville route arrived at Edwina’s home in Kensington offering to help find and arrest the male driver, three other men and two females. Edwina asked to look at several vans and drivers, but she could not identify any of them. One taxi owner, who asked to remain anonymous, said he was horrified that someone who works with them could have done something so evil.

I am ashamed of what has happened and that is why we are going to try and help find these guys because this impacts our income as well.” Edwina was emotional when complete strangers offered to help her. “Ek ken nie eers die mense nie en hulle wil my help(I do not even now these people and the want to help me),” she said. But she hopes to confront her attackers before they are arrested. “Ek gaan hulle hard moer. Ek gaan hulle seermaak net soos hulle my seergemaak het (I am going to hurt them just like they hurt me),” she warns. Edwina is still traumatised by her ordeal and recovering from deep-tissue bruising on her legs, hips, back and thighs. Her throat is also sore from being continuously choked. She claims her robbers took her groceries and handbag with ATM card, which they used to withdraw R1 000. The police have made no arrests as yet and the matter is still under investigation.

My lazy nostalgic traditional Sunday dinner at home. Amanqina enkukhu (chicken feet), pap and veggies... took me back home to Mdantsane back in the days... teaching my kids to all sorts of foods to widen their palette in both traditional and modern / global cuisines ❤️🍴😋 #NomNom #traditionalfood #food #instafood #yumyum #amanqina #chickenfeet #foodiethings #nostalgic #maotwana #ButEnjoyedBestUsingYourHands A post shared by Siba (@sibamtongana) on May 7, 2017 at 11:12am PDT

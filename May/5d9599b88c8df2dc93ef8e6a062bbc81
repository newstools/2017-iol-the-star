Police spokesperson, Xoli Mbele, said the arrests were made in the early hours of Monday morning. “It is alleged that suspects raped a 22-year-old female,” said Mbele. “The victim was coming from work with her co-worker when they were confronted by the suspects. The male co-worker was assaulted and pointed with a firearm, they dragged the female to the dark building and took turns raping her”. Mbele said the rapists also robbed the woman of her cellphone and money. The assaulted man managed to call the police, who responded promptly and arrested 11 suspects. The 22-year-old was taken to hospital, where she was examined by doctors. African News Agency

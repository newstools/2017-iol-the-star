Cape Town – Buhle Mkhize, the alleged former mistress of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, had SA tweeps hanging onto her every word as a Twitter account with her name unloaded some files on Gigaba and his wife Norma. Mkhize, a US-based fashionista, appeared to have created a new Twitter account on Tuesday to hit back at Norma, who had seemingly referred or implied she was a prostitute in an interview with eNCA at the weekend. Mkhize threw many jabs in Norma's direction, including questioning her education and calling her a liar and a deceiver. In numerous tweets, she also called Norma "Homonaledi" and "Nomachule". According to Mkhize, Norma ended up blocking the "side chick" (as many Tweeps called her), which Mkhize thought was "embarrassing" to her. Mkhize made slides, which she posted on Twitter, "so no one twists my words". Here are some hilarious reactions to Mkhize's revelations:   #BuhleMkhize just wondering who is going to pick up the rand after this. pic.twitter.com/nNTpYKRgt4  — Khuthadzo Munyai (@khuthadzomunyai) May 9, 2017    Msholozi looking at Buhle tweets and thinking. now I have to reshuffle again ...🙄🙄🙄 pic.twitter.com/4tKH4Ua8e3 — 🍃🍁Ⓜ️ilanos🍁�� (@1st_ninjar) May 9, 2017     On the real, #NormaGigaba and #BuhleMkhize are both victims of #Gigaba 's dishonesty.  — Nelisiwe Msomi (@NeliMsomi) May 9, 2017     Omaigot!.I've never laughed so much reading my timeline....#buhlemkhize #Buhle takes the crown....😂😂😂😂...when's the next episode?  — Nick Mchunu (@mchununickn) May 9, 2017     #buhlemkhize  we didn't sleep because of you just drop that file mtase funukwazi nathi  — malumecharles (@lubisimasana) May 10, 2017    And then came #buhlemkhize like Chuck Norris.

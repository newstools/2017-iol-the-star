The nine-year-old boy was found murdered in a field in Lenasia on Friday after he went missing last Tuesday. During a memorial service at the Saaberie Chishty Hall,  family, friends and fellow pupils from Flamingo Primary School in Lenasia paid tribute to this “special little soul”, known as Keke to those close to him. Community representative Mickey Padayachi said: “Young children and women are increasingly becoming the target of violence. This needs to stop, and we can only do so if we stand together." Transport MEC Ismail Vadi sent a message of condolence to the family and said he was deeply distressed over Keketso’s “merciless killing”. Keketso will be buried in Orange Farm on Saturday.

The study, published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity, is titled: “Traversable acausal retrograde domains in space-time”. In the paper, mathematicians from the University of British Columbia and the University of Maryland proposed a mathematical model for a viable time machine. “In this paper we present geometry which has been designed to fit a layperson’s description of a time machine,” they wrote. “It is a box which allows those within it to travel backwards and forwards through time and space, as interpreted by an external observer.” One of the researchers, Ben Tippett, said: “People think of time travel as something fictional and we tend to think it’s not possible because we don’t actually do it. But mathematically it is possible.” Any time travel machine would probably need to be able to warp space-time - the connection between time and physical dimensions such as width, depth and height. Evidence suggests huge gravitational forces, such as those emitted by black holes, can slow down time. The scientists’ model is based on a similar idea: that a strong force could disrupt space-time and “bend time into a circle for passengers”, which would, in theory at least, mean people could travel faster than the speed of light and therefore go back in time. - The Independent

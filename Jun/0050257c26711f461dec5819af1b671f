The league also wants the department to incorporate anti-racism lessons into the curriculum to avoid “unprecedented racial wars”. Speaking ahead of their picket outside Pietermaritzburg Girls’ High School tomorrow, regional secretary, Thembinkosi Zondi said the league believed racism at former white schools was alive and well. The school made headlines after an alleged racist incident by a pupil occurred. The pupil has since been suspended. “We believe this is not an isolated incident. Hence we want the Department of Education to investigate and root out this evil,” he said. Zondi said racism was embedded in “some households” and called on the department to exercise its responsibility of educating the next generation to unlearn “toxic behaviour”. “Children learn racist attitudes at home and take them to school. The department must incorporate anti-racism lessons in the curriculum to help pupils who will then even correct their parents at home,” he explained. He said the picket was not targeting Pietermaritzburg Girls’ High School, but the league was going to use the incident to highlight racism at all prestigious schools. Yesterday, the Young Communist League in the Moses Mabhida region also protested outside the school. Secretary Mandisa Shezi said the picket was aimed at raising awareness about racism at former white schools. “We can’t have a situation in South Africa in 2017 where a white pupil refers to black pupils as k***irs. It’s unacceptable,” she said. Meanwhile, an online petition calling for an anti-racism policy to be implemented at the school has gained traction with over 800 signatures. The petition, addressed to the Pietermaritzburg Girls’ High School governing body (SGB), was created by 23-year-old Zamaphephetwa Nzimande, who matriculated from the school in 2011. Among the list of demands is that the alleged culprit offer an unreserved apology to pupils and that she be barred from taking on leadership roles at the school.

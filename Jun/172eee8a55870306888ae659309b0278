He said the administrative action was necessary in order to improve road safety and ensure tested vehicles were roadworthy. Vadi said the testing equipment was also necessary to calculate brake requirements on vehicles and provide a printed report. The department had initially identified 46 non-compliant stations. However, after conducting inspections, 24 stations received suspension notices. Vadi said the department would be willing to lift the suspensions once the vehicle testing stations could prove the required equipment had been installed.

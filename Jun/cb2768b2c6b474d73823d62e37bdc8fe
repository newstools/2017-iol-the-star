Scientists have revealed that enjoying regular sex could be the best remedy for avoiding killer heart disease - although somewhat unfairly only for the male of the species. Making love several times a week can slash levels of homocysteine - a chemical in the blood that can trigger cardiac problems, a study has found. But women do not get the same benefit, because their sexual arousal is less dependent on a healthy blood flow, experts said. Men who enjoy regular sex often have better circulation and healthier blood vessels, which helps prevent a build-up of homocysteine. Coronary heart disease is Britain’s biggest killer, with around 73000 people a year dying from the condition. Doctors have long suspected that frequent sex can reduce the risk of heart attacks. A previous study found intercourse twice a week halved a man’s chances of clogged arteries compared to less than once a month. But until now there has been little scientific evidence. The latest findings, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, are the first to reveal the link with reducing homocysteine levels. The chemical is a vital building block of proteins and occurs naturally in the body. - Daily Mail

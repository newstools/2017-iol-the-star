Frew recently shot the video for her new song Dance and is now asking fans to feature in the video with her. The Los Angeles-based singer and songwriter has asked fans to send clips of themselves dancing to the track to stand a chance of being in the final music video. The video itself was shot in Los Angeles, and the chosen fan clip will be included in it. “I wrote Dance the morning I found out a close friend of mine was a drug addict. It made me stop and think because someone who, at least from the outside, seemed to look like he had it all together clearly struggles within,” said Frew. She wanted the song to be uplifting and about making the most out of your life. “Always looking for that silver lining and loving yourself,” she said. Frew is well known to her South African fans for her feature in multi-award-winning DJ and producer Black Coffee's hit song I'll Find You. She also performed at Coachella this year, alongside DJ SNBRN, for the hit song You Got Me in front of 15 000 people. Fans need to email their video clips dancing to the track to Frew’s team by tomorrow. The final edited Dance video will be released at the end of this month.

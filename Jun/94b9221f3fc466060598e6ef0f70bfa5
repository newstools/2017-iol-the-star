MURDER accused Sandile Mantsoe, 27, will today resume his bail application this morning in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court for the murder of his lover, Karabo Mokoena. Mantsoe is also charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice. During Mantsoe's previous court appearance on May 24, Magistrate Carel Labuschagne barred the media barred from reporting or publishing on "sensitive" information that might emerge in the bail application. However, Labuschagne later said the media would be allowed to report and broadcast the judgment of the bail application. This morning Mantsoe's family could be seen sitting quietly in court before proceedings Mokoena had been reported missing for a few days before she was found dead.Â Her charred body was found in a veld in Bramley in April.

The interim board will continue with its work until its term expires in September. In a notice issued on Friday, communications portfolio committee chairperson Humphrey Maxegwana said institutions and individuals were invited to nominate persons to fill vacancies for non-executive members on the SABC board. He said nominations should be addressed to the committee by June 30. The portfolio committee was assured last week that advertisements aimed at filling the vacancies would be placed in weekend newspapers. “That process is moving so that as they (the interim board) finish their term, we will appoint the permanent board,” Maxegwana had said. President Jacob Zuma appointed the interim five-member board, led by former Business Unity South Africa chief executive Khanyisile Kweyama, in March for six months. The appointment of the interim board followed a parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of the then board to hold office. However, former communications minister Faith Muthambi has taken the report on judicial review. The report, which is supported by all the parties except the UDM, blamed Muthambi for “displaying incompetence in carrying out her responsibilities as a shareholder representative” at the SABC. It found that she interfered in some of the decision-making of the board, and also irregularly amended a memorandum of incorporation (MOI) in order to centralise power in the ministry. The committee found that Muthambi had also violated provisions of laws and codes of conduct and should be reported to the institution’s ethics committee and Zuma for the institution of charges. The DA’s Phumzile van Damme has since called on current Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo not to pursue the court case and ensure that not a cent of public funds was spent on the case. “In line with her oft-said commitment to restore public confidence in the Communications Department, Minister Dlodlo would do well to withdraw this litigation,” she said.

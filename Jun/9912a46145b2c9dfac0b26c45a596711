And, as part of the initiative, a novel South African exhibition opened yesterday that will give visitors to the LE BHV Marais Paris department store the chance to experience artisanal home and fashion items created by 30 South African designers across various design categories, including furniture, home ware, décor, accessories, fashion and beauty. Julie Hatchuel, the curator and project director, said the purpose of the exhibition - the first of its kind in Europe - was to help support local designers reach broader audiences. As the European market was different  from the South African one, she wanted to guide designers and accompany them on their journey. Mandla Sibeko, the director of Artlogic, which was key to driving the project, said the trade export opportunity the exhibition offered was a step in the pursuit of getting high-quality South African products into stores and homes worldwide. The fact that Lafayette had 60000 visitors a day meant it was an invaluable opportunity to expose international buyers to South African products. The event is on until the end of next month. Earlier, aspects of Africa Now included window displays of work by Nigerian photographer Lakin Ogun Banwo and a gallery exhibition titled “The Day to Come” which included work by South African tapestry artist Igshaan Adams. - Val Bojé

Today, the DA was expected to march to the Emfuleni local municipality offices to demand that he resign from his
position. According to the DA, the ANC-run municipality is in debt and is not able to collect much-needed revenue from ratepayers. The official opposition accused Mofokeng of not paying attention to the problems facing the municipality. Instead, the mayor was prioritising his lavish lifestyle, said the DA’s Kingsol Chabalala, the party’s constituency head in Emfuleni. “Mofokeng is an embarrassment to the ANC and the Gauteng provincial government,” said Chabalala, adding that the municipality was dogged by problems such as mismanagement of public funds and resources. The DA said it was expecting thousands of its supporters to join the march, due to start at the licensing department. The march will be led by John Moodey, the DA leader in Gauteng and the party’s members of the provincial legislature. “Enough is enough. Mayor Mofokeng and his cronies have taken enough from the poorest residents in Emfuleni,” charged Chabalala. Municipal spokesperson Lebo Mofokeng was quoted as saying expenditure associated with executive offices was not unique or limited to Emfuleni, but normally “related to entertainment, stakeholders’ engagements, business meetings, and investor engagements in the execution of his official functions”. @Sabie _M

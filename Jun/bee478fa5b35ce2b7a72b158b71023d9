 The arrest of six people could be a breakthrough in the matter regarding the discovered of three charred bodies in Tshwane and a kidnapping in Northcliff. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Kay Makhubele confirmed the arrests on Thursday morning. The three bodies are believed to belong to a family from Northcliff, Joburg, who were kidnapped from their home on Sunday evening. The kidnappers fled in the family’s Mercedes-Benz. The bodies were discovered by security personnel from Copperleaf Golf Estate; finding the three bound, gagged and burnt. The bodies were of a 56-year-old man and two women – aged 54 and 22 respectively. "Indeed, as they (investigators) were following information, yesterday, they managed to track the vehicle, which was taken from the house. (This) led to the arrest of one suspect, who went all out and pointed (out) the other suspects.” "Also, the electric appliances, which were taken from the house, were also recovered." He also said  the Mercedes-Benz, another car which was used during the commission of the crime and a firearm  were recovered from the suspects. “And it is indicated that these suspects are linked to the killings of the three, which were found burnt beyond recognition. However, we will be awaiting the DNA results to confirm that,” the colonel said. Asked by Gwala what the motive behind the crime was, Makhubele said: “It appears to be an ordinary house robbery as we established that one of the suspects was an employee of (one of the) deceased before for more than 12 years. So, it is clear that the motive of this incident was two crimes. However, we will make sure that we investigate thoroughly and make sure that these people get what they deserve.”

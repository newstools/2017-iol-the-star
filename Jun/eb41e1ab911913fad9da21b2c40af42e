This was after the police and Unicef, where she worked as associate director, confirmed that the body found on Platteklip Gorge was indeed hers. Her decomposed body was found on Tuesday at 10.15am by detectives and park rangers. “We learnt with great sadness the remains of our 
colleague Charlotte (Nana Yaa) Nikoi have been found,” Unicef 
spokesperson Najwa Mekki said. “All of us at Unicef are deeply saddened by this news and express our personal sympathies and condolences to her family. Nana Yaa was a committed colleague who devoted the past 18 years of her life to the work and values of the UN.” She applauded the South African authorities for their assistance. Chris Nikoi, speaking from New York, about to board a flight to Cape Town, said he was devastated at the news of his wife’s death. “I’m not even sure how to feel at this point. I would have liked a different outcome.” Charlotte went missing on March 21 after hiking with her husband and daughter Kochoe at Platteklip Gorge. The DA’s acting leader Bonginkosi Madikizela called for an urgent investigation into the cause of Nikoi’s death. - Staff Reporter

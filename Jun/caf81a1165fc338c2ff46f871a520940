The July is a classy and elegant affair, so whether you are wearing a hat or not, you can wear your hair up or down - but remember to wear it to suit your overall look and personality. The theme for race day, “The Colour of Magic”, provides the perfect inspiration for an elegant up style. Bespoke’s hair styling team, which styled all the models’ hair for the Vodacom Durban July Fashion Showcase presented by the Durban Fashion Fair, provided a few style options (see below) to consider for race day. “You can adapt the looks to suit your own style and personality. Don’t be afraid to play around and try alternate styles with your outfit on,” Bespoke Hair stylist Claire Swart said. “We’d love more people to pay attention to their hair at this year’s Vodacom Durban July. Just remember to not over-style it. Keep it beautiful,” stylist Lynelle Maistry added. Plaited bun with a twist: A side bun looks super chic and tidy especially when you wear a hat. This style can be intricate or simple, with plaits added or super curly. The Durban July is renowned for being quite windy and cold later in the day and this style will stop your hair from blowing. A definite show stopper. Iconic movie star: Think Audrey Hepburn meets Lady Gaga - this style triumphs over all buns. This is the ultimate movie star of the 60s look. Low curly bun princess loop: Up dos are not only practical but also remarkably stylish. Perfect from weddings to formal events.

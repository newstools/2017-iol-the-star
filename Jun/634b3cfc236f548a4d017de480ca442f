The CoJ has given notice of its intention to defend the claim. A criminal charge was laid in April relating to the alleged irregularities and unlawful manner of the disposal of portions of the Huddle Park property, and it was further alleged that perjury, fraud, forgery and uttering were committed during the disposal process. The criminal case was opened at Hillbrow police station in Joburg and then transferred in April to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks). The essence of the criminal charges is that the CoJ disposed of an asset of the state in an allegedly irregular, unlawful and fraudulent manner to a non-compliant tenderer, which caused prejudice to both the city’s ratepayers and other short-
listed tenderers. Complaints were lodged with several entities, including the Special Investigating Unit and the Johannesburg Commercial Crime Unit, and a review application was lodged with
the CoJ, which was subsequently withdrawn. Two processes were undertaken for the disposal of portions of the Huddle Park property. The first, initiated in September 2004, was terminated in 2009. A bank-led consortium was the only entity to respond during the second process, which resulted in
it acquiring 52.7 hectares of the
Huddle Park site for R46 million in June 2011. A so-called inde- pendent valuation obtained by the Johannesburg Property Company (JPC) for the 52.7ha of Huddle Park was R40.052 million. An investigation by Business Report revealed this valuation was done by Thapelo Mmusinyane, an internal candidate valuer at the JPC, and “checked and certified” by George Ramovha, a registered professional valuer. Their valuation compared the site to a property adjacent to the Diepsloot squatter camp. A complaint was lodged against Mmusinyane and Ramovha at the SA Council for the Property Valuers Profession (SACVPV) in November 2012. Both were found guilty at an SACVPV disciplinary hearing last November of improper conduct.

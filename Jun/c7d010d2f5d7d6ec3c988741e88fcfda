This is the one piece of advice DJ Fresh has for anyone who plans to spend their first December weekend with him and Euphonik on the party cruise, OH SHIP! “This is the fifth one for me and I think the Saturday night pyjama party, where people are in their PJs on the streets until the morning, and the party goes on until around 9am on the Sunday,” said the Metro FM morning show host about his favourite memory on the yearly cruise. His set is from 6am on the Sunday and it can go on until the cleaning staff tell them to stop. “Some people are able to carry on and go to the end, but others end up staying in bed because they have overdone it the last few days. So it’s all about pacing yourself,” he advised. The annual 72-hour ocean party will be taking place from December 1-4 and will see the DJs provide entertainment for their fans with their popular house beats. The MSC Sinfonia will set sail from Durban to the Portuguese Island in Mozambique and return to Durban. Fresh, whose real name is Thato Sikwane, recently released a single for Africa Day and is working on remixes to come out of it before the end of this month. He will also be at the SA Music Conference that will be taking place during the Durban July weekend. “It’s something Euphonik, Greg Maloka, Oskido, Vinny da Vinci, Christos and I work on every year,” he added. House heads can also look forward to the 10th edition of the iconic Fresh House Flavour. “There’s also a brand new blog-type app that we will be launching that is interactive and different from other artists and apps as you know them to be,” he said. Bookings for the OH SHIP! party cruise are open and those who want to be part of it are encouraged to start choosing their cabins now and pay their deposits. DJ Fresh said there would be some surprises on the cruise this year. “We will have live performances and the comedy is going to be bigger and better. People can expect world-class fun.” @mane_mpi

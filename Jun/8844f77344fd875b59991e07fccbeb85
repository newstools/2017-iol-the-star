The TONGHT party is back next weekend in Newtown and promises a bigger and better line-up that includes SA Music Awards-nominated hip-hop star Stogie T, Melo B Jones, Kaya FM DJ Kenzhero and 5FM DJ Kid Fonque. The third instalment of this event will also be brought to party lovers by urban culture specialist, publicist and designer Maria McCloy, who is thrilled to be part of the event which she insists caters to an older crowd. Another special feature of the gathering is that it is meant to be savoured and not spent on social media the entire night and for this reason no cellphone pictures will be allowed on the dance floor. “We started this in February to fill the gap in the party market that barely caters to a crowd aged between 28 and 45 or so,” she said. DJ Kenzhero, whose real name is Kenneth Nzama, said the TONGHT party had been such a hit that there were plans for three more this year. “People love the music and the atmosphere,” he said. “They tell us it feels like something different on the Joburg scene.” DJ Kid Fonque, who was born Allan Nicoll, reiterated that the event would be enjoyed by the older crowd. “They dug coming to an unfamiliar venue, that the crowd was grown-up and even the fact that no cellphone photos were allowed on the dance floor,” he said. The pair have been a feature of the TONGHT party since since the debut event in February. “This concept called TONGHT was conceived out of the constant chats we have had throughout time,” explains Kenzhero, who mixes on Kaya FM every Saturday from 9pm until 10pm.

They were among 12 staff members across the Western Cape, including teachers and caretakers, to have been charged for sexual offences between April 2016 and March 2017. Of those charged, five were found guilty and dismissed; four were found guilty and received sanctions of final written warnings or fines; one resigned after being charged; and two were found not guilty. Department spokesperson Millicent Merton said a total of 982 cases were lodged for various transgressions during the same period. She said 593 employees were formally charged in the province. A total of 443 cases were either dropped due to a lack of evidence or were referred to supervisors to issue warnings. When it came to those charged for sexual offences, most of them were teachers, while some were school caretakers and foremen. “The department consistently requests dismissals for these type of offences,” Merton emphasised.

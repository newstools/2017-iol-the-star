 What will you be doing on Father’s Day? Both my dad Bennie Peters and stepdad Johan Steenkamp love the simple things in life. For them there is nothing quite like spending time with family. My stepdad is based in Sedgefield, so I will spend the weekend with my dad and stepmom in Potchefstroom. I will spoil my father with his favourite food, which is a good cut of rump on the braai, pap and sous, potato salad and tiramisu for dessert.  What is the most important thing your fathers taught you? Both my dad and my stepfather are extremely hard working. They have truly earned anything that has ever come their way. The one thing I learnt from them is that you will get nothing by sitting back and waiting for a miracle. Another valuable lesson was to always treat other people as  you would like to be treated.  What is the fondest memory of your father when you were growing up? My dad has only daughters, so he has no one to talk rugby with. I remember before hockey trials in primary school, my dad taught me all his high school rugby tricks and skills in the hope that it would help me in my hockey trials. It must have worked because I made the 
first team.  Did your fathers ever embarrass you and how? Without a doubt. One New Year’s Eve my stepdad and I were lighting star lights on the beach. Johan accidentally put the star light in his jacket pocket and threw the lighter away. It didn’t end well.  Your message to the fathers of South Africa? There’s a big difference between caring for and babying one’s daughter. Both my dads raised me to be a strong, independent and courageous woman without ever pressuring me to be someone that I’m not. I will always be grateful for that. My wish is for all the dads out there to raise their daughters to be the best version of themselves.  What will you be buying for your father this year? I like to make gifts personal. I am planning to get my dad tickets for a classical music concert that I know he would love to go and see.

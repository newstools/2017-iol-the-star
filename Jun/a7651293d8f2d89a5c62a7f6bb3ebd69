 PARAMEDICS made a grisly discovery after burnt bodies of two adults and a 13-year-old were found in a veld in Centurion this morning. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics were called to the scene around 8am where they found bodies lying in the veld. “Unfortunately, all three patients had already succumbed to their injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead on the scene,” Mering said. “It would appear that the three patients were bound, gagged and burned to death, but is subject to post mortem and law enforcement investigation.” He said details surrounding the incident unclear at this point as investigations are ongoing. Meanwhile, two children burnt to death in a fire at Dunnotar Military Base Quarters near Nigel yesterday. According to police, the incident occurred when the parents of a 6-month-old baby girl and a 12-month-old baby boy left the babies sleeping with a heater on yesterday afternoon. Apparently the heater exploded, setting the beds alight.  The father was rushed to a nearby hospital after he attempted to rescue the children.

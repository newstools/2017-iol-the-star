“The 10111 employees would like to present this memorandum of demands to the Honourable Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula, expressing our deepest frustration at the slow pace and the deliberate delaying tactics to implement the processes that will improve the terms and conditions of our employment,” Bethuel Nkuna, a representative of the 10111 employees, said. The working conditions of the emergency call centre were poor, compared to other government service call centres, he said. “As a result, a joint task team was established in February 2013 and it completed its work in April 2016. This task team eventually recommended that the employer commission a job evaluation exercise to help determine the appropriate pay packages for 10111 employees,” Nkuna said. “The 10111 workers are demotivated because they are underpaid. This should be treated with extreme urgency.” Mbalula was given 14 days to respond to the memorandum which was received by senior officials from his office. The South African Federation of Trade Unions, led by general-
secretary Zwelinzima Vavi joined the protest. Vavi said Mbalula must ensure workers’ demands were met. “A deal is a deal. An agreement signed by former police commissioner Riah Phiyega was signed on behalf of the police,” he said. - ANA

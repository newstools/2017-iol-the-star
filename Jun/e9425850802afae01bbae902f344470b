Johannesburg - At least 13 prison officials face suspension over the issue of strippers performing a "strip show" for inmates at the Johannesburg Prison. This follows the Department of Correctional Services hastily organising a press conference to give clarity on saucy pictures that circulated social media and were also on Daily Sun which showed strippers entertaining prisoners at the prison. In one image, two strippers appear to be undressing a willing inmate while he holds his hands up and in another, a stripper is seen giving an inmate a hug. The images have since gone viral and sparked much outrage. Acting national commissioner of Department of Correctional Services James Smalberger condemned the incident and apologised to all South Africans who were offended by the images.    "The report we received on the preliminary investigation show that the pictures taken were of an event hosted in line with the June Youth Month Celebrations on the June 21 at the Johannesburg Medium B Correctional Centre." "The management of the event should have never allowed and immediately halted, this type of explicit entertainment as pronounced by our policies," said Smalberger.    nokuthula.zwane@inl.co.za The Star

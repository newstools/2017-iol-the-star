Johannesburg The actress who was shot and injured at her Joburg home on Wednesday morning was believed to be Celia Kriel who appeared on popular Afrikaans soapie 7de Laan. This was according to multiple media reports who said Kriel was the victim of the shooting. However, police were yet to confirm the identity of the actress or the circumstances which led to the shooting. Paramedics were also unable to provide a name but said the victim was recovering in hospital where she remains in a serious but stable condition. Netcare 911 spokesperson Chris Botha said an armed gang entered the house in Randburg just after midnight. Reports from the scene indicate that several gunmen had entered the premises of a popular actress, shots were fired and she sustained two serious gunshot wounds, he said. Following the shooting, paramedics were called in and they treated her before she was taken to a nearby hospital for further medical care. Botha said the actress was found in a serious but stable condition. The patient was treated at the scene and then transported to a specialised hospital under the constant care of an Advanced Life Support paramedic, he said. Exact detail to the incident and preceding events will however remain a subject for police comment. [email&#160;protected] The Star

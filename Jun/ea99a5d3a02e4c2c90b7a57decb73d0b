The Gauteng Department of Education yesterday said the online application system closed at midnight yesterday and “no exceptions will be made for those who have applied late”, according to spokesperson Steve Mabona. More than 300000 learners were expected to be placed in schools across the province after they applied before last night’s deadline, said Mabona. He said although the department would not be admitting pupils whose parents applied late, no children would stay at home with no schooling. “We will have to entertain them next year. Constitutionally, we cannot turn anyone away if they seek placement of their children,” Mabona told The Star. He warned, however, that in cases where a school was full, the department would “not unfortunately oversubscribe any school”. He added: “Those who applied late will have to opt for the nearest school.” The department received 269676 applications, which was close to 60000 (59921) more than in the same period last year. Among the schools that had the highest number of applications was PACE Commercial Secondary School in Soweto with 419. Other schools which received many applicants were Mondeor and Northcliff high schools in Joburg, Pretoria High School for Girls and Hoërskool Akasia in Pretoria, and Boksburg High School in Ekurhuleni. According to the department, between now and the placement period, schools will submit their lists to districts for verification and approval. The placement period is expected to start on July 24. “Once parents receive an offer of placement, they are advised to accept or reject the offer. If parents do not respond, the offer will be given to other parents in the queue,” Mabona pointed out. He said the department was grateful to all parents who applied online and on time, especially with the significant increase in the number of applications during the final days. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi thanked parents for their overwhelming response to the online admissions. @Zwane_2li2ls

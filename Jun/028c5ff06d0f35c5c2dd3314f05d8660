Johannesburg - The scramble to choose the next candidate to lead the ANC intensified on Monday, with the National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) backing Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. This followed Nehawu calling on the ANC to get its house in order ahead of the policy conference this weekend, and the elective conference in December. Ramaphosa, who was addressing Nehawu’s 11th national conference in Boksburg, did not mince his words on state capture. Ramaphosa assured Nehawu that the ANC was not confused about who it stood for. He said the party has always had a bias for the working class. “We don’t have to choose. We know where we stand,” he said. On state capture, Ramaphosa said while leaked e-mails spewed everything, the announcement by President Jacob Zuma on the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry had to be welcomed, as the whole truth would be revealed there. He implored workers not to be spectators to the political drama unfolding in the country, but to play a role in uniting the alliance and helping to mobilise the masses, as well as intensify mobilisation in the run-up to the 2019 elections. Meanwhile, Dr Blade Nzimande was concerned that their revolution was in serious danger. “We need to discuss how to rescue it. We cannot walk over leaders and allow the country to be led by an Indian family. We didn't struggle for that,” the higher education minister said to loud applause. It also didn't matter what colour monopoly was, but that monopoly should be fought, he added. The Star

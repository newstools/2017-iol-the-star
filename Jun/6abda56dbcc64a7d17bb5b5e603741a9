Johannesburg â€“ Christopher Kubheka, who rose to fame as Gunman in the hit show Yizo Yizo is believed to have committed suicide at his house in Soshanguve, Pretoria. Speaking to The Star on Tuesday morning, Captain Mavela Masondo said the 48-year-old actor's wife returned from work to find him hanging on the burglar door. It is not known what time Kubheka died but his wife discovered his body around 4.30 yet neighbours are said to have seen him around 3pm. Masondo said they did not suspect any foul play but were investigating the matter and had also opened an inquest case. Kubheka also played the role of Bazooka on the drama Zone 14 and he had at some point in his career ventured into music. One of the popular songs he released was GunChes, in which he had collaborated with former Yizo Yizo star Ernest Msibi, who played Chester in the popular school drama. A year and half ago, Tshepo Ngwane, who played the role of Thiza also in Yizo Yizo, had to be buried with donations from Good Samaritans following his death from stomach ulcer. The Star

Johannesburg - On Monday, we carried a front-page story saying Pastor Paseka “Mboro” Motsoeneng had prayed for former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng (no relation) to become president of South Africa. Pastor Mboro has denied this, and argues that his recorded sermon shows he prayed for President Jacob Zuma so that God leads him to do the right things for the sake of our country. Hlaudi indicated he was endorsing a woman for president in 2019, so this means he can’t be running to be the leader in that election, but in future. So Mboro couldn’t have prayed for someone who doesn’t even have a party or a chance to be president in 2019. “I prayed for Hlaudi to have a voice, to play an important role in society. I pray for politicians, celebrities and all kinds of people. Everybody is welcome at Incredible Happenings Church,” said Mboro. The Star also used a subhead that unfairly referred to Mboro as a “fake” prophet. We retract that statement and unreservedly apologise to Mboro. The Star

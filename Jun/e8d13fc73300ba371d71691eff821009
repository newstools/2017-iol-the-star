Thando Mazibuko was allegedly stabbed with a screwdriver early yesterday following a night out with friends in Yeoville, Joburg. The incident happened while they were returning to a guest house at which they were staying. Yesterday, Thando’s father, Godknows Mazibuko, said he was in shock after hearing of his son’s death. “Right now we are getting different stories coming from the friends who were present at the scene and the police,” he said. “What we were told by a girl who claims to be his girlfriend was that he was fighting with some other guy over her. According to his friends, he was stabbed in the street, and later found himself in a  guest house he had earlier booked. They found him dead without any clothes on.” He added: “What we don’t understand is why the guest house did not enquire, and act fast when they saw Thando.” A distraught Mazibuko said Thando was the only child he had, and that his mother lived in Argentina, following their separation in 2004. He was expecting the police to investigate the incident thoroughly and bring the suspect to book. Gauteng police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said the suspect was on the run, and no arrest had been made by last night. A case of murder had been opened at Yeoville police station. According to Netcare 911 spokesperson Chris Botha, paramedics arrived at the scene to find Thando in cardiac arrest. They were unable to save him. @Zwane_2li2ls

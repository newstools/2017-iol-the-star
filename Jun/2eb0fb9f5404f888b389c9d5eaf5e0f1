 In addressing the fake news websites, the Gauteng South African Police Service had dismissed all allegations that there was a Hillbrow police station robbery while officers were sleeping this week. Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini addressed the news and told The Star  that he had no idea how the story came about. The article in question, had no formal time or date of the event. The story which was reported on a gossip site this week stated that “11 police officers were robbed of their pistols while they were sleeping by nyaope addicts". The fake news that has been doing the rounds has been directly dismissed by the SAPS. “The news that police in Hillbrow were robbed of their pistols  and stolen goods while they were sleeping have been received with dismay by the Gauteng South African Police Service management,” said Dlamini. “No pistols and stolen goods have been stolen at the police station while police officers were sleeping,” he said.

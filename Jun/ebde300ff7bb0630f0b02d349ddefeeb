Johannesburg â€“ There was relief and a sense of justice prevailing after two cop killers who murdered two Vereeniging police officers were sentenced to four life sentences. Acting Gauteng Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Eric Nkuna has welcomed the sentencing of Eric Bango and Wiseman Thokozani Mazibuko who killed the police officers in 2012. "Through tireless and commitment of the team, we are happy that criminals who kill police officers and rob members of the community received the sentece they deserve and will spend most of their life time in prison. "We wish the sentencing of these criminals will send a strong message to criminals that police will leave no stone unturned to make sure that killers of police officers will never rest until they are brought to justice," Nkuna said. The two men were sentenced to four life terms and more than 100 years in prison after they were convicted on 12 counts including murder, attempted murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, possession of a firearm without a licence and possession of ammunition. A third accused Nhlanhla Malope who was found in possession of a firearm stolen from one of the police officers was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. Two police officers, Warrant Officer Thomas Moagi and Constable Daniel Tshakela, were attending a complaint of house robbery in August 2012 when they were attacked. On their arrival at the crime scene, the men fatally shot the officers and took their firearms, two pistols and an R5 rifle. The accused also used the police van to flee from the scene before they hijacked another person of his Toyota Tazz. A police team lead by worked around the clock to trace the accused. During continuing investigation, the accused were arrested and all the firearms stolen from the police officers were recovered. @Lanc_02  ilanit.chernick@inl.co.za  The Star

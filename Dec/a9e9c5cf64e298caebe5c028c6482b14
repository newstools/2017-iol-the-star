People from all corners of the world descended on Emperors Palace to witness the Mrs World beauty pageant at the weekend. Hosted for the first time in South Africa, the event saw 40 of the world’s most beautiful women compete for the title. The event was hosted in the Centre Court of Emperors Palace in Kempton Park. Hosted by Katlego Maboe, the finalists were then cut down to the top six and then the top three. Mrs Hong Kong, Alice Lee Giannetta, who took the crown from last year’s winner, Giuliana Zevallos of Peru, said winning meant she would be able to do more to help those who were less fortunate in her country and around the world. “I have a passion to look after those in need. I am involved in many female-empowered projects. So winning this is more of a selfless achievement, because it’s all about the next person,” Giannetta said. Mrs Belarus and Mrs Costa Rica were the first and second runners-up, respectively. Although she did not win the crown, Mrs South Africa Nicole Capper made it into the top six. The 40 women arrived in the country last week. They went on a heritage tour of Ekurhuleni and on safari at the Lion and Safari Park. The group were also treated to a cultural tour of the Lesedi Cultural Village. On Friday, a preliminary round was held. The Star

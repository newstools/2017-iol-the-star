Just a week ago controversial prophet Shepherd Bushiri sent shock waves across the nation following the unveiling of prices for the upcoming gala dinner with prices ranging from R1 000 to R25 000. The event will reportedly be held on 23 December at the Pretoria Showgrounds. As if that was not enough, the Malawian pastor took to Facebook to show off his daughter's 6th birthday present. Prophet Bushiri bought his "little princess" Uproar over price to dine with #ShepherdBushiri Together with the images of the luxury car, Bushiri paid tribute to his daughter: "I always count myself blessed during this time of the year because I get the honor to celebrate, not only one but two God-given gifts in my life. I celebrate the birth of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and also the birth of our first daughter, Israella Bushiri... "My sweet little daughter, my pride and joy. May God's loving kindness always shine on your beautiful face. I prophesy long life! You shall be great and yours, shall be a life that heaven celebrates. Happy birthday my princess!" While some of his social media followers thought this was cute, others thought the pastor is out here "robbing" the people.

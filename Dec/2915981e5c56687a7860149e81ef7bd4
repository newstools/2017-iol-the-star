“If I can say it in one word, it’s been amazing. I will say that people love Michael Jackson so much that they welcome people like myself that keep his spirit alive.” He has performed his acclaimed tribute to the late, great superstar Michael Jackson  for many audiences in places such as the Eiffel Tower, Moulin Rouge and Champs-Élysées in Paris. From his performance at the Roodepoort Theatre, Jonathan said the audience could expect a lot.  “The essence of Michael Jackson is his signature dance moves. Both my team and I deliver these to precision, outstanding music and passion is the order of the day.” As a child, Jonathan watched one of the icon’s shows on TV and it changed his life.  “I immediately knew that this was my calling, I have dedicated my life to being the best Michael Jackson impersonator. My audiences agree with this,” he said. The French performer has always wanted dance to be his career.  “I love dancing and it’s part of me.” He will be performing exhilarating dance routines to songs such as Billie Jean, Thriller, Beat It and The Way You Make Me Feel.  This will not be the first time he has been to the country. He was here 10 years ago.  He has performed at the then Coca-Cola Dome, Montecasino and the Barnyard Theatre for various shows including the Heal the World Show. The 90-minute show with a short interval promises to be an amazing spectacle with backup dancers and singers. The production is on from December 6 to 17. Shows start at 8pm on weekdays and 3pm at weekends.  Tickets are available from R100 to R120 at the theatre.

Johannesburg - South Africa's ruling party will forge ahead with making changes to section 25 of the republic's Constitution to give effect to its objective of expropriating land without compensation, African National Congress (ANC) subcommittee chair of socio-economic transformation Enoch Godongwana said on Wednesday. At a media briefing at the ANC's 54th conference in Johannesburg, Godongwana conceded tempers flared during a debate by conference delegates. He denied reports on social media that members came to blows, prompting newly elected party chairman Gwede Mantashe to call security. "Mantashe did not have to call security. He had himself to step in..and calms the house down," he said. Godongwana said there were conditions attached to the decision on expropriation without compensation, which was adopted at the party's policy conference in June. The sustainability of going ahead with it. "What are the conditions for sustainability? Among those narrated [is] it must not impact on agricultural production, food security and other sectors of the economy." Section 25 of the South African Constitution deals with property rights, and while it allows for the expropriation of land for public purpose and or in the public interest, it clearly states that landowners must be compensated by the government.

It was all things “monate”, as The Star celebrated its 130th Christmas party in Limpopo. My experience at the Monate Lodge was unforgettable with hundreds of perfect photo opportunities, Wi-Fi connection, luxurious rooms and beautiful views. As a photo opportunist, I made sure that I kept my followers up to date with my hourly posts on what we experienced at the lodge. Imagine, a day where you can arrive and find yourself jumping into the nearest pool with different types of buck grazing and squirrels darting around as your backdrop. The animals, the breeze and an amazing view of the sunset was all a girl needed to get away from the big city. Visitors can be sure that they will be fed throughout their stay, because I left the lodge feeling like I had gained a couple of kilograms. Breakfast in the bush, lunch in an exclusive restaurant and dinner in a cave was quite an experience for me.  Karishma Dipa: The week was winding down when we arrived in Limpopo and although we all came to Monate Game Lodge to relax, we couldn’t help but bring Joburg’s stress along. What really helped me unwind was the game drive in the evening. With the fresh breeze blowing through my hair, I put my feet up, cuddled with a blanket and took the sights of the bush in. After I watched the animals in their natural habitat, the ultimate highlight of the trip was having sundowners on top of a mountain. My colleagues and I spent quality time bonding and taking pictures together in the scenic venue.

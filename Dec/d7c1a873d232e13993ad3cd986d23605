Johannesburg - The body of the nine-month-old baby snatched during an attempted rape of her deaf-mute mother three days ago has been found. Baby Kutloano Maloitsane’s decomposed body was found on Tuesday at about 6:30pm near Abattoir in Parys, Free State. “The body which was found in a decomposed state was discovered by a passer-by in the bushes and he alerted the police. Due to the state that the body was found in, it was difficult to determine how the baby died and a postmortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death,” said provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motantsi Makhele. Yesterday, Makhele said Kutloano of Tokoloho Section in Tumahole was allegedly snatched by an unknown male after 11pm on December 16. “It alleged that the mother of baby Kutloano was walking to her parents’ house carrying the baby on her back when she was approached by an unknown male who forcefully grabbed her by the hand and attempted to rape her. “She managed to get away but unfortunately the baby fell down and the unknown male took the baby and ran away. The mother is deaf and mute and she couldn’t scream for help...” Makhele said. Acting provincial commissioner Major General Tollie Afonso decried the senseless killings of children. “The community needs to stand against abuse and senseless killing of our innocent children. Whilst we still working round the clock to find the person who allegedly snatched baby Kutloano from her mother which led to his senseless death. “We plead with the community to assist with information if such a person is known by contacting [the investigating officer] Detective Captain Lois Ferreira at 083 419 7361,”  said Afonso.

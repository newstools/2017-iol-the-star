Spokesman Simon Zwane said more than 3000 people had already been arrested for violating traffic and road laws since the beginning of December, 1300 of them for driving under the influence of alcohol. Other transgressions included driving unroadworthy vehicles, speeding, and driving without a licence. Zwane said more than 1100 cars had been impounded thus far, and another 1600 discontinued because they were not roadworthy. He warned motorists to be careful on all major South African routes, urging road users to exercise extra caution on the N3 towards Durban, the N2 in KwaZulu-Natal and in the Eastern Cape. The N1 between Limpopo and Gauteng and the N1 and N2 in the Western Cape were also routes that usually had a high accident rate. 'Prepare for congestion' “Please do your part, plan your trips properly," he urged, “Also, be patient with other road users, conduct yourself properly.” An estimated 2000 cars an hour are expected to pass through the Pumulani and Carousel plazas on the N1 north. Traffic authorities have warned travellers, especially on the busy N1, N4 and N3 routes, to prepare for congestion as people make their way to popular resorts or home for the Christmas season. Bakwena Platinum Corridor Concessionaire spokeswoman Charmaine van Wyk urged motorists to take extra precautions on the road, especially at designated traffic hotspots. “Whether driving to the coast, mountains or bush, motorists must plan their travel routes before their departure, allowing sufficient time to reach their destinations and bearing their safety and that of other road users in mind at all times,” she said.

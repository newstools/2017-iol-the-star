Johannesburg - A small group of bare-breasted girls have gathered at the Pieter Roos Park in Parktown for a protest march against media giants Google and Facebook. The girls will march to the Beyers Naude Square in the CBD. Organiser Lwazi Dlamini from TV Yabantu said Google and Facebook have been discriminating against the girls by deleting their pictures of themselves wearing traditional regalia that shows their breasts. "This is woman abuse. The girls cannot post pictures of themselves wearing traditional regalia because they will be deleted." "Why is that happening because these girls are showing that they are proud of their culture," Dlamini said. He said on Tuesday, Google and Facebook shut their doors on the girls.    "The girls just wanted to have a conversation with them but they were blocked from entering the premises of these companies," Dlamini said. 
Busi Madonsela, 18, from Tembisa in Ekurhuleni said she wanted to be able to wear her traditional attire and not be abused. "When we walk around the taxi rank, taxi drivers touch us inappropriately. That is abuse. I'm here to showcase my culture which I am proud of. "I want to be able to wear my traditional attire on any day and be able to post pictures in the media. They must not be removed because that is discrimination," said Madonsela. Nomhle Mokoena said she was proud of her culture and had nothing to be ashamed of. "I want people to see that I love my culture and I'm proud of it. We are not seeking attention but want to be allowed to post our pictures in the media," she said. * Due to a previous ban, we have made the decision to not use images of the protesters. The Star

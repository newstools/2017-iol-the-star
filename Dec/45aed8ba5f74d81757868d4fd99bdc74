Asked on Ramaphosa's chances, Mbete said it "does look positive" and said she thought that "unity was paramount" at the conference. "Therefore, part of what this is is about giving meaning to unity so that we don't talk unity that has no meaning. But we talk unity that is practically going to give us something more tangible." On Saturday, the ANC postponed the contentious issue of credentials to Sunday amid a NEC decision to bar some delegates from voting. Earlier the conference was delayed for at least eight hours as the ANC NEC held an impromptu meeting to iron out the contentious court judgments and decided to exclude KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, and North Westâ€™s Bojanala district from voting at the conference. The leadership of these regions have had to contend with court challenges brought by disgruntled members. The second day of the conference will commence with a business breakfast session. Delegates are expected to be in the plenary by 9am. African News Agency and Politics

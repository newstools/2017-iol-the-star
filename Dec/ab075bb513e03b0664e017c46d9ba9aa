THE Road Traffic Management Corporation is clamping down on corruption this festive season.  On Monday,  they arrested four employees of a private roadworthy testing centre after uncovering a scam.  RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said the employees were arrested in a joint operation by the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit, the police’s Organised Crime Unit and Gauteng Traffic's Compliance Unit. The officials were busted after investigations uncovered a scam in which the identity document of a 64-year-old bed-ridden man was allegedly used to fraudulently process roadworthy certificates for hundreds of vehicles. Zwane said: “It is believed that the vehicles were never physically examined before the certificates were issued. Many motorists who visited the centre with the hope of obtaining fraudulent documents ...were disappointed to discover that the centre was temporarily closed.” The four were  expected to in court on Wednesday on charges of corruption and fraud. Zwane said the latest arrest bring the number of suspects arrested in different private roadworthy centres to about 20 in the last three months. More arrests are expected.  “Unroadworthy vehicles pose a major danger on the roads and contribute to a significant number of accidents. The RTMC is working with other law enforcement agencies to minimise the number of such vehicles on the roads in a concerted effort to make South African roads safe," he said.

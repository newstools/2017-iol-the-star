Johannesburg - Parents of children attending Bryneven Primary School in Bryanston gathered at the school on Tuesday morning to protest against the principal whom they accused of fraud, corruption and mismanagement. Standing in the rain, they held placards, some of them read: Stop Bullying our teachers; Garib Must Fall; Aim High and Garieb the tribe has spoken. Phillippa Da Costa who has two children at the school said about 14 teachers have resigned since Shamin Garib was appointed in September last year. "We have concrete proof of her dealings. Mismanagement of funds as well as nepotism. We just want to make it clear that this is not a racial issue, we just want to restore our school to its former glory," said Da Costa. However, Videshni Naidoo Singh -the previous chairperson of the School Governing Body- said the previous principal was a white person who was equally corrupt. "Her previous school has also warned us that we she is a thief. We have compiled a forensic report and we just want the right thing to be done," she said. MEC Panyaza Lesufi rished to the school after hearing that the parents were busy protesting at the school. He asked for some time to make a decision regarding the findings after engaging with the staff and SGB members. The Star

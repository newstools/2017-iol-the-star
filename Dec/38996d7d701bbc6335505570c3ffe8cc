Johannesburg - A sangoma and an initiate drowned and died during a traditional ritual in the weekend. The two were among the three people that the Sand River, also known as Tikwe, in Free State, swallowed during the evening ritual on Friday. Police spokesperson Captain Malebo Khosana, said seven people went into the river during the ritual but some of them could not manage the water depth and swam leaving three behind. The group could only save one while the sangoma,27, and another man aged 18-years-old drowned.  Khosana said police divers discovered their bodies on Saturday morning. “The first body was found not far from where they drowned. The second body that of a sangoma was found several metres from the drowning spot, already floating on top of the water. They were certified dead on the scene and taken to Welkom state mortuary,” said Khosana. He added that these rituals were common in the Welkom area. “Even during the rescue operations we saw another group performing rituals on the other side of the river,” said Khosana.  Acting Station Commander of Virginia Lieutenant Colonel Thabo Coobi warned the community about the dangers of the river. “The most important rule of water is that everyone should respect water and the surrounding environments. People should refrain from using the river if they cannot swim especially if there is no one who can act as a lifesaver in cases of drownings,” said Coobi. The Star

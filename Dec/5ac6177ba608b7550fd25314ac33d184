According to reports, the ANC leaders were expected to meet at 8am on Saturday morning - two hours before the start of the national conference. Addressing delegates, Gigaba stressed the need for an investigation into state capture. "We need to fully investigate this to restore public confidence," he said. Gigaba also said the Steinhoff scandal, which saw the company face a near collapse after its share price tumbled by about 80% recently, needed to receive the same scrutiny as other public scandals. The minister also touched on the necessity of Radical Economic Transformation (RET) in today's economy. "At this moment, the most important task is to lead South Africa to inclusive growth through RET," he said. Also giving a brief address at the breakfast was outgoing ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize, who touched on the recent court battles affecting the party.

“Our name comes from the area code of Mthatha, but we are now based in Joburg,” said 19-year-old singer Ngcali Nundu. Together with his band members, Lihle Baleni and Sihle Mdaka, the trio are ready to have their voices heard.  “We met while in a competition and we were all in different groups back then.”  After staying over in a hall where they were performing, the trio started to sing together. “We spent the night there and started to jam and write songs together. It became a jam session. When that ended we realised we have a connection without voices, so we decided to start this thing and sing together.” It has been five years since the youngsters started on their road to success.  Their passion for music is what unites them and they are using music to tell their stories and show their proud Xhosa heritage.  The band are inspired by the likes of The Soil, Vusi Nova, Nathi, Ringo and Afroctration, and their aim is to bring a fresh take on what a boy band is. “If you watch 047 perform live, it is our natural stage presence, precision in the delivery of our craft and passion for the storytelling that is visible in our voices.” The newbies have already shared the stage with Afropop king Ntando and their mentor Vusi Nova.  Vusi Nova fell in love with their music while they were accompanying a friend who had come to the singing sensations for advice.  They signed to Muthaland Entertainment and released their first single, Ubuhle, featuring Vusi Nova, in September.  The group are still working on their debut album, but they know that Afrosoul is their genre.  “We are going to bring the soul to the music. So for the rest of the year and for the first bit of 2018 we are pushing the recording of the album. People must be on the lookout for great music,” said Nundu.  The album is due out in March.

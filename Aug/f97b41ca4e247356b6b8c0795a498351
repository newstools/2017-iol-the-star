Two men had been arrested following an altercation with the police, who ordered them to stop disturbing traffic on the R80 route, as taxis made their way into the CBD for a protest. Their colleagues demonstrated outside the court, where they briefly appeared on a bail application. They were granted bail of R400 each. Earlier, some demonstrators damaged the gate when they tried to force their way into the court premises. They later dispersed and headed to Tshwane House after police at the scene called for back-up. There was chaos across the city’s townships when taxi drivers went on strike. They marched to Tshwane House in protest against the issuing of traffic tickets, which blocked their efforts to renew their professional driving permits and vehicle licences. Police spokesperson Zanele Mtshweni said the two men were arrested following a confrontation with the police at around 10am. “They were arrested on charges of public violence,” she said. Mtshweni said the strike began soon after 7am, with taxi drivers blocking the R80 and Soutpansberg Road. On their way into the city, some taxis drove towards oncoming traffic and while some ferried taxi drivers, others were loaded with tyres. Metro police officers and the SAPS kept watch and redirected motorists on the R80 to alternative routes. Motorists were cautioned by traffic officers to be careful as their vehicles could be damaged.

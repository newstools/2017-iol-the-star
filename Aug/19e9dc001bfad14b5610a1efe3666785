The man, believed to be in his 20s, was found dead with gunshot wounds and severe head injuries, and his hands and feet were bound. A case of murder is being investigated. Kempton Park police spokesperson Captain Jethro Mtshali said: “All we can say is that the investigation continues. No one has been arrested. We appeal for the next of kin or anyone who knows of the incident to come forward and have the body identified.” Paramedics arrived on the scene around 8am after a farmworker alerted authorities after spotting the body. “Paramedics were led to the body, which was found lying about  600m from the road. On closer inspection, paramedics saw that the man had sustained several large wounds to his head and showed no signs of life,” said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. According to Mtshali, this isn’t the first time such an incident has occurred in the same area this month. “The body of a man, of around the same age, was found in an open field in Bredell. “He also had some bruises and we believe  that he was also killed and dumped there,” said Mtshali. He believes that once the SAPS has information, the police can manage to crack the cases. - Nokuthula Zwane

She is expected to battle it out with other beauties from around the globe in the global beauty pageant, which is expected to take place in November. The venue and country where it will be hosted are yet to be announced. This will be the 66th year it will be held. The current title holder is Iris Mittenaere of France. The last time a South African won a Miss Universe pageant was Margaret Gardiner, back in 1978. Other Miss South Africa winners who triumphed on the international stage include Penny Coelen, who was the country’s first Miss World, in 1958, and Anneline Kriel, who took over the title of Miss World in 1974. More recently, Rolene Strauss was crowned Miss World three years ago. Nel-Peters is hopeful that she will follow in their footsteps. Although the prestigious beauty competition is still months away, she said her preparations for the pageant were already well under way. “My preparations started when I was crowned Miss South Africa 2017.” The BCom graduate, who hails from Sedgefield in the Western Cape, said she was well aware of the honour and the responsibilities the Miss Universe title brings. “Just as with the Miss South Africa platform, I understand the responsibility of being Miss Universe and the impact it has on millions of lives.” Nel-Peters said she was thrilled to fly the flag high for South Africa. “I am extremely excited and proud to represent our Rainbow Nation and cannot wait to wear the name ‘South Africa’ proudly across my chest.” To help her do so, Nel-Peters will be assisted with preparations by pageant coach and fashion stylist Werner Wessels and Miss South Africa stylist Noreen Kajee-Vareta. Nel-Peters is expected to jet off to the Miss World pageant a few weeks ahead of the ceremony, which is expected to be held on November 26.

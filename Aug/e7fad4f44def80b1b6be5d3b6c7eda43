Spokesperson Gugu Ndima said the city manager, Dr Imogen Mashazi, learnt that the employee wrote an email with the following words to her colleagues: “Ek is moeg met hierdie bobbejane hier, hulle dink ek sal bedank soos meneer van der Nest en ek sal nie.” (I’m tired of these baboons here, they think I’ll resign like Mr van der Nest and I will not). Ndima said: “The email correspondence was sent on July 21, 2017 and it came to the attention of the city manager on July 31. “Naturally, and as expected (in terms of) the process, an investigation was conducted to affirm the legitimacy of the email and the authenticity, and that it had been authored by the employee. Subsequent to the outcome, it was resolved that the employee be dismissed,” she said. Ndima told The Star that a black female recipient of the email reported the matter after being offended by its contents. She said that the remarks were sent on the municipality’s official email, which includes its logo. “It is tarnishing to the City of Ekurhuleni and that is why a summary dismissal was the ultimate decision taken to deal with the matter,” Ndima pointed out. She said that the city wanted to make it clear that it has a zero-tolerance approach towards racism and that it will deal harshly with any instance that is brought to its attention. “The city views racist conduct as constituting exceptional circumstances, as envisaged in law, and as such the employer can dispense with pre-dismissal procedures. “This commitment by the city will be implemented in respect of every aspect of the scourge of racism, whether by employees or members of the community who are conducting business with the city,” she said. In a council sitting yesterday, mayor Mzwandile Masina said: “Racism will not be tolerated in the City of Ekurhuleni. We have a dark past of racial injustices and no one will undermine efforts to build a non-racist, non-sexist and democratic society.” @Zwane_2li2ls

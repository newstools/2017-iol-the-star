It was revealed in court on Wednesday that he instructed her not to attend court and allegedly promised her a good life with him once the case was finalised. Limpho Molise, the only State witness to appear in court on Wednesday, said in her evidence that she received several calls and SMSes from the Danish national, who is being held at Johannesburg Prison. The communication was allegedly between July and the start of Frederiksen’s trial on August 14. “The accused called me suggesting we should go and stay together where Tshidi was staying,” said Limpho, who took the witness stand under tight police guard. In some of the messages read out in court, Frederiksen presents himself as a victim confident that the case would soon go away and he would be able to restart his life with his children and Limpho. But in what seems to be a veiled threat for her not to testify against him, he says in one message that no one from the Molise family should come to court for the trial. “I promised him no one would attend because I was scared. I have been living in Pretoria since Tshidi passed away,” said Limpho, who is originally from Maseru, Lesotho. Frederiksen contacted her at least six times just before the trial, but she did not respond. “In one message sent on August 10, he wrote: “Dear Limpho and all the children, “The time is coming close to Monday. I pray to God every day so that we can be together. Regarding our children’s future, I feel sorry for (the two sons, whose names cannot be published as they are minors). It will be nice. “Good night, “Peter.” The Star

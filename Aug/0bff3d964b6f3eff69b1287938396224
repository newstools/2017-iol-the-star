Johannesburg - Police have launched a manhunt for two men believed to have been involved in the rape and robbery of a woman in a taxi in Florida early this year. Spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said they have identified two men suspected to be linked to the crime. This stems from an incident in which a woman and her 10-year-old son boarded a taxi in which she was later robbed of jewellery, wallet, bank cards, cell phone, house keys and R1 700. The woman also reported that she had been raped by one of the suspects. Dlamini said in a statement that the stolen bank cards were later used by the suspects to purchase several goods including liquor. “Police are appealing to anyone who may have information about the two men who allegedly used the victim’s bank cards to come forward. A reward of up to R50 000 will be offered for any information that may lead to the arrest and successful prosecution of the suspects,” said Dlamini. This incident was part of several cases that were reported to the police earlier this year which prompted the Gauteng Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Deliwe De Lange to establishe a team of detectives from the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit, according to Dlamini. Cases were reported to have occurred in Meadowlands, Booysens, Johannesburg Central, Rosebank, Alberton, Germiston, Kliptown, Protea Glen, Langlaagte, Honeydew and Dobsonville. “Up to date the investigating team has managed to arrest four suspects whose cases are pending at the Protea and Johannesburg Magistrate Courts,” he said. Police urge the public with information on the suspects to contact the investigation team leader, Captain Elon Bester: 079 890 7472 or Constable John Mokoena on 071 675 6166 at all hours. Anonymous information may also be forwarded to Crime Stop at 08600 10111. The Star

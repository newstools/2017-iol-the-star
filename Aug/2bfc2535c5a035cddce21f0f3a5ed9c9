Investigating officer Marlon Appolis yesterday told the Western Cape High Court that police had circulated Van Breda’s explanation of an alleged suspect, which was his body build, height, and balaclava-covered face. State prosecutor Susan Galloway asked if that yielded any results, to which Appolis responded: “Nothing.” During cross-examination, Van Breda’s legal representative, Pieter Botha, questioned whether anyone would be able to tip off police with just that information. Appolis said: “You’d be surprised how many leads we get with a little bit of information.” In his plea explanation, Van Breda said that on January 27, 2015, a laughing axe-wielding man wearing a balaclava killed his mother, Teresa, 55, father Martin, 54, and brother Rudi, 22.  He said the same person also tried to kill his sister Marli. Van Breda alleges he was able to disarm the intruder, who then ran out of the house. Van Breda, 22, handed himself over to police, and faces three counts of murder and one of attempted murder, to which he has pleaded not guilty. The green-headed axe found to be the murder weapon also came into focus yesterday, when Judge Siraj Desai asked Appolis if it was the only one recovered at the scene. Appolis said the axe, retrieved by forensics, was indeed the only axe in the house. It was covered in blood, and later examined for DNA evidence. Botha said a previous witness, Marli’s then boyfriend, James Reade-Jahn, had testified that he remembered the Van Bredas having a black-headed axe. Appolis referenced previous testimony from domestic worker Precious Munyongani, who said the family kept their axe in the pantry. Appolis said that when police arrived at the scene, there was no axe in the pantry. The case continues on Monday, when a blood spatter expert is expected to testify. - Francesca Villette

JOHANNESBURG – After months of hype which has reached hysterical levels, top boxer Floyd Mayweather Junior and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) champion, Conor McGregor will face each other in the aptly-termed “money fight” in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Saturday evening. SuperSport is broadcasting the fight live from 3am on Sunday SA time. It will be available to Premium customers on SuperSport 2 and SuperSport Maximo for no additional cost. Mayweather will be aiming for a record 50th successive win as a professional. McGregor, for all the hype, will be engaging in just his first professional boxing contest. Yet this fight has more to do with marketing smoke and mirrors than boxing. Both will cash in like never before, with their superstar status guaranteeing millions of television viewers around the world. Mayweather is a slick operator, who fights by the maxim of hitting and not getting hit. He has fast hands and the best defence in the game, qualities he’ll need against McGregor. The Irishman is bigger and stronger and will be unorthodox, given his unfamiliarity with boxing. He’s vowed to destroy Mayweather inside four rounds, although that is the sort of boast Mayweather has heard many times before. His previous 49 opponents have tried and failed to beat him. With Hollywood stars scrambling for ringside tickets and regular fans trying to get their hands on tickets, which range in price from $500 (R6 626) to $10 000 (R132 621), it’s as big a fight as Las Vegas has ever seen. The undercard offers more traditional fare, with top fighters like Badou Jack and Gervonta Davis appearing. African News Agency (ANA)

The ANC has said it would discipline at least three of its MPs who had publicly stated how they voted. But Parliament yesterday warned those questioning the process, saying it had been beyond reproach. The ANC has said at least 26 of its MPs voted with the opposition last week. Zuma survived the motion by 21 votes after 198 MPs voted for him to stay and 177 voted against him. Nine MPs abstained. Some ANC leaders have warned against conducting a witch-hunt against MPs who sided with the opposition. Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said the use of a secret ballot was beyond reproach. Speaker Baleka Mbete decided on a secret ballot a day before MPs voted in the National Assembly. This followed a Constitutional Court ruling that she had powers to decide whether to use a secret or open ballot. Mothapo said Parliament had noted the issue in public on how MPs voted last Tuesday. He said all the necessary measures had been taken to ensure the integrity of the process, and it would not be possible to know how individual MPs had cast their ballots. After the votes were cast, the ballot boxes were taken away and put under lock and key, and only Mbete or the courts may open the boxes. “The rigorous confidentiality measures regarding the motion of no confidence were endorsed by all parties, and are similar to those employed in the election of the president and presiding officers since 1994,” said Mothapo. The SACP also entered the fray and warned against a witch-hunt of the ANC MPs who voted against Zuma. It called on Zuma to resign - or for the ANC to recall him - because of the problems linked to him.

This forms part of the inner-city renewal programme. Yesterday, the programme was launched at the Joburg Theatre - one of the three theatres managed by Johannesburg City Theatres (JCT). “The community development department of the City of Joburg expresses its commitment to the revitalisation of the inner city through the support it gives to programmes facilitated by, among others, the JCT," said member of the mayoral committee for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba. "These programmes are intended to bring about social cohesion, celebrate the diversity and dynamism of the city, and also to promote inclusivity.” The relaunch of the JPO and Joburg Ballet forms part of the city’s contribution to targeting deprived spaces and communities through arts and culture. “To give effect to this, the city has contributed R10 million and R8m to the JPO and Joburg Ballet respectively over three years. "The funding is to be used to roll out programmes that will attract and entertain the diverse people of the city through the creative arts,” she said. Formed in 2000, the JPO is Johannesburg’s only philharmonic orchestra. It was formed as a response to popular demand by music lovers in Gauteng. To date, JPO offerings have included Queen: The Concert, The Joburg Pops, La Traviata and La Boheme. In the relaunch, the JPO will be offering music lovers a special concert programme featuring internationally renowned artists. Joburg Ballet is home to some of South Africa's top dancers and choreographers, offering classical and contemporary dance. “We are privileged to be associated with the JPO and Joburg Ballet, as both seek to bring social cohesion through creative arts," said Sifumba. "We are proud of their continued effort to attract high-profile and world-renowned artists in order to bring joy to the people of Joburg.” @annacox

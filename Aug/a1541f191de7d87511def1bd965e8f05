You may know her from 5FM, Generations — the Legacy and My Perfect Family, now
Thando Thabethe is set to join the TLC Entertainment family to present her brand-new talk show, Thando Bares All. Super excited to finally let the world know about my Brand new talk show "Thando Bares All" coming to @tlc @tlc_africa in 2018 🦅🦅🍸🍸🎉🎉🎊🎊🎈🎈 A post shared by Thando Thabooty Thabethe (@thando_thabethe) on Aug 21, 2017 at 1:29am PDT “When
 TLC approached me to present this show, I was ecstatic. I am a huge fan
 of the channel and thoroughly enjoyed working with the brand as a judge
 for its Next Great Presenter competition in 2016. This for me is a step
 in the right direction for my career in the entertainment industry. I 
can’t wait to start filming Thando Bares All and finding out what South 
Africans think about the topics that really
 matter," said Thabethe. With the studio elements led by Thando, the show will also be co-presented by TLC Next Great Presenter winner
Carissa Cupido, who will front immersive breakout pieces, finding
 out what the public thinks on the personal subjects that will be 
discussed in each episode.

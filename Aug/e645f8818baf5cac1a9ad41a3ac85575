Frederiksen is accused of slicing off clitorises from women in illegal operations at his rented townhouse in Bloemfontein. Defence lawyer Marius Bruwer told social worker Anna Mart Dreyer during cross-examination that he had been instructed by Frederiksen to tell the court that Molise had had poor parenting capabilities because she liked partying, drank a lot and had several relationships. Bruwer said that when Frederiksen raised his concerns, Molise would go to the police claiming domestic violence and she often pressured him to give her money as a way of blackmail. Dreyer, who works for the provincial Department of Social Development, was called to testify because she handled Molise’s complaint on September 16, 2015, when she allegedly sought help following a domestic dispute with Frederiksen. It was also on that day that Molise spilled the beans on the human body parts her husband kept in a freezer in the house, prompting the police to be summoned. The Hawks found a plastic bag in a locked deep-freezer containing 21 clitorises. “It is my instruction that Tshidi (Molise) always made false reports to the police each time they had a fight,” said Bruwer. But Dreyer replied: “I wouldn’t know that.” Bruwer said Frederiksen, who is also accused of cutting off Molise’s clitoris without her consent, had instructed him that his late wife had consented. But Dreyer said: “She said she didn’t consent. She said she lost part of her life from the cutting and felt grossly abused.” Frederiksen has remained behind bars since his arrest in 2015.

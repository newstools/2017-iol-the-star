The new mom and BET presenter is the new face of beauty soap brand Lux. “I’m ecstatic about this partnership and honoured to join the ranks of legendary South African women who I admire.” The 29-year-old said Lux spoke to so many women in the country and she was happy to be associated with it. It was her eclectic style and look that made her a perfect fit for the brand. “We are happy to have Nandi join our Lux family. Her wide-ranging roles, from mother to TV personality, make her the perfect Lux woman. “Her mix of modern and traditional, both in taste and through her music, is so representative of Lux,” said Unilever personal care PR manager, Sphelele Mjadu. Last week, the official TV commercial starring Madida was aired and depicts the musician and actress in various locations also showcasing her music capabilities. Lux also has a brand campaign, We Are More, that features female powerhouses Lira, Nhlanhla Nciza of Mafikizolo and the youthful Moneoa. The campaign highlights the beauty of women both inside and out. “Madida mirrors our brand shift perfectly because of her multiple roles, on and off screen,” added Mjadu. Madida joins not only the three singers but also businesswomen and icons of power Khanyi Dhlomo, Basetsana Kumalo, Joanne Strauss, Sonia Mbele and Felicia Mabuza-Suttle, to have partnered with Lux. “These women are all representative of the many layers that make up a woman; whether as leaders in business or mothers raising a family.” - Staff Reporter

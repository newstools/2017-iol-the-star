The 16-year-old was selected to battle it out against other title holders from around the world. Mpho is no stranger to pageants as he holds other titles, including Mr Junior South Africa. He is also the founder of the Mpho Charl Botha Diabetic Foundation, 
a non-profit organisation that 
helps children living with diabetes. The young man has been struggling to raise funds for his trip to represent the country at the Mr Teen Universe pageant. He still has to raise over R100Â 000 for him to be able to attend the event and welcomes any 
sponsorship. The event will be held in Bodrum, Turkey, from September 23 to October 4. starnews@inl.co.za

The Incredible Happenings Church leader earlier this week gave Mkhwanazi-Xaluva until yesterday to “repent” and change her mind about laying charges against him. When she didn’t, he issued her with court papers. The CRL was set to lay charges against Motsoeneng for refusing to appear in front of the commission during their probe into the commercialisation of churches in the country. He also wants the notice compelling him to appear before the commission suspended. Motsoeneng said Mkhwanazi-Xaluva was not fit to hold office and should resign within seven weeks. In court papers, Motsoeneng said Mkhwanazi-Xaluva has attacked his dignity on a number of occasions, adding that she called him a “false prophet, a corn artist (sic), that he is stealing money from the public and he is a criminal” on television. He said the commission had not received any complaint against him and his church. “There was no intimation that there is even a suspicion that the applicants are suspected of commercialising religion or of any abuse on their part, instead the applicants were chosen at random.” He has given her until next week to respond to his lawyers, but said he wants her and the rest of the commission members to resign in seven weeks. “I have given her enough time and she must resign. We have no faith in her because she is biased,” Motsoeneng said. The CRL has criticised Motsoeneng for what they see as his continued attack on Mkhwanazi-Xaluva for spreading “lies, incitement and fear” regarding their report into the commercialisation of religion.

The Dark Tower actor was poking fun at his co-star after he was named Rear of the Year last week, but after giving him the moniker, he checked to make sure it wasn’t a worldwide accolade. McConaughey quipped: “He’s got a trophy - the ass of class. “Is this an English award? Is it an international ass?” he asked. In a joint interview with Entertainment Tonight, Idris replied: “It’s not international, it’s England. I think I’m Rear of the Year in England. “That morning when the announcement came out, I took a good look in the mirror and I was like, ‘Okay, fair enough’.” McConaughey saw the funny side of Elba’s comments about his derrière accolade, but was left speechless. He added: “I don’t know I don’t know what to say about that. I wasn’t expecting (it).” Tony Edwards, organiser and boss of the Rear Of The Year Awards, said the Luther star had won the prize for having a “well-toned, firm” behind. He said: “Idris is also a kick-boxer which, along with his other workouts, has ensured a particularly well-toned, firm rear.” Edwards, who awarded British TV presenter Rachel Riley with the female Rear of the Year gong - also insisted it is not always the “biggest butt” which triumphs. He added: “Both Idris and Rachel’s celebrity rears represent perfect examples of today’s toned and firm gluteus maximus - with quality rather than quantity as the essential fashion keynote. And biggest is not always best.” - Bang Showbiz

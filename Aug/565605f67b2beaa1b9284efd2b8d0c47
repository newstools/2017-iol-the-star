The award-winning producers will join another local talent, DJ Maphorisa, in Brooklyn, New York, for the annual lifestyle and music affair. TV personality Nandi Madida will be hosting them as master of ceremonies on the Green Stage at the Commodore Barry Park. Maphorisa and Black Motion are in the DJ line-up. Shabaka and jazz ensemble The Ancestors will also be performing at the festival tomorrow and on Sunday. Madida will be making history as the first African to host the Brooklyn event. “I’m ecstatic and honoured to announce that I will be making history as the first African to host Afropunk Brooklyn in New York City. Dreams really do come true,” she posted on her Instagram page. Black Motion will woo festivalgoers with their energetic dance stage act, using decks and drums to bring their performance to life. The Pretoria-based pair - Thabo Mabogwane and Bongani Mohosana - have four albums to their name and will give their audience a taste of their music, including their hits Imali, Rainbow, Teenage Love Affair and It’s You. Maphorisa, who has been doing several DJ sets in the US, will thrill fans with his beats. He has produced for the likes of Major Lazer, Jason Derulo and Trey Songz and was behind some of the hits from Nigeria’s Wizkid and Davido and South Africa’s Black Coffee, Oskido and Emtee, among others. Like Black Motion, Maphorisa is also a Pretoria resident. The Soshanguve-born producer’s career was catapulted by his 2013 hit Y-Tjukutja. In 2014, he produced and featured on Mafikizolo’s pan-African smash hit Khona, which won a 2014 MTV African Music Award. Maphorisa was also a producer on the 2016 Kwesta hit Ngud. Afropunk has been around for 14 years and is also staged in Paris, London and Atlanta. The Brooklyn leg will give South Africans a taste of what’s to come at the Joburg event in December.

Despite the incident taking place last week, the cabinet decided not to interfere with the matter, and said Manana would make up his mind. Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo told journalists at a post-cabinet briefing yesterday that the incident had not been discussed by the cabinet. However, the cabinet had discussed gender-based violence, she said. “The cabinet discussed along the lines of Women’s Month gender-based violence and people being given support, so that no victim faces undue pressure,” said Dlodlo. “We did not have a specific discussion on Mduduzi Manana. Manana was appointed by the president,” she said. Calls have been mounting for Manana to be fired. But Dlodlo said this was not discussed and it was up to President Jacob Zuma to decide, as Manana was appointed by him. But Manana could also decide on his own if he wanted to quit. The ANC has said it will discipline Manana for the incident. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said the ANC’s national working committee had decided at its meeting this week to discipline him. Manana was a member of the ANC Youth League before he was promoted by Zuma when he arrived in Parliament in 2009. Dlodlo also refused to be drawn on the matter of Grace Mugabe, after the Zimbabwean first lady was reported to have assaulted a young woman in Sandton. She would not comment on talk of diplomatic immunity for Mugabe. She said the police and the Department of International Relations were handling the matter. The DA yesterday called for Mugabe to face the music. Its spokesperson for police, Zakhele Mbhele, called on the State not to allow Mugabe to get away with the crime she is alleged to have committed. He said she must face the full might of the law, and that she did not qualify for diplomatic immunity. He accused the police of dragging their feet over arresting Mugabe. Mbhele said Mugabe was not above the law and should be arrested.

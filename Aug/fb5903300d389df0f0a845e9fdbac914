Cape Town - Shaheed Omar, nephew of the late minister Dullah Omar, has been shot dead in an apparent attempted hijacking in Lansdowne, Cape Town on Thursday evening. He died at the scene. His father, Dr Adam Omar, is a well-known community doctor in Rylands.
 Reports say that the family has confirmed that Shaheed was killed in the hijacking. Police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk said on Friday that a murder case has been opened. "Circumstances surrounding a shooting incident last night at about 20:30 on the corners of Lansdowne Road and Jan Smuts Road, Lansdowne where a 38-year-old man was fatally wounded are under investigation. A murder case was registered for investigation," Van Wyk said. "Anyone with any information about this fatal shooting incident is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop on 08600 10111." The Omar family were in the news recently after they distanced itself from the pro-Zuma marches earlier this week and requested the removal of Dullah Omar's name from the ANC Cape Town Metro Region.

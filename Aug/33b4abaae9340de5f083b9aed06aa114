This is the view of Lin Songtian, the People's Republic of China ambassador to South Africa. He arrived in the country a fortnight ago. He has dedicated himself to improving diplomatic relations between the two countries, which are trading partners and form part of the Brics bloc. “China puts people ahead of government. We have a mantra that says 'don’t forget the people or you’ll be forgotten by the people'. "That’s why the Communist Party of China has a purpose to follow people wholeheartedly. You have to be ready to serve the people and forget about yourself,” he said. The former ambassador to Liberia and Malawi arrived amid high political tension in the country, with the ANC more deeply divided than ever and grappling with factionalism in its ranks. Lin also arrived at a time when civil society and opposition parties have in many instances cast doubt on President Jacob Zuma’s leadership, including instituting a motion of no confidence in him in Parliament. Lin pointed out that in his country, leaders were not too concerned about who should lead, but rather to focus on the task at hand of how to ensure that the country is run effectively. “We don’t have to worry about who will be president; whoever is in that chair has to ensure that the economic growth of China is not less than 6%," he pointed out. "Ten million students graduate from higher learning institutions. My government has no choice but to create 10 million jobs. We have no time to fight among ourselves "We have to push hard,” he said, adding that while China was a socialist country, it too strives to achieve democracy. “Sometimes Western people don’t understand why China is so stable. It’s because people are happy. The president consults everyone, including the military, before taking decisions.”

Lebogang Kenneth Motsagi has already begun his journey to the top, and is set to parade his latest collection in London next month, if he can get funding to make the trip. Motsagi, born and bred in Kimberley, Galeshewe, is a fashion designer, stylist and a freelance photographer, based in Cape Town. He matriculated in 2014 from the Kimberley Technical High School and has always been fond of the arts, and enrolled in 2015 at the Central University of Technology in Bloemfonten to chase his dream. He said he could not afford the tuition fees and eventually dropped out of the institution and sold his art works to survive. In the pursuit of a better life, he applied for a bursary in Cape Town and was fortunate enough to be granted one at the Cape Town College of Fashion Design. Unfortunately, circumstances forced him to leave the institute, he said. “The same thing happened with my first year. Although tuition was handled, I had no accommodation or food, so I dropped out and started selling my art again to make a living,” said Motsagi. Motsagi said he also continued seeking other opportunities and was fortunate enough to be accepted at an exhibition, which will document his life story and will be taking place in London, at the Brick Lane Gallery, from September 15 to October 2. “I was invited to an exhibition in London but the problem is I have no money to get there. “So I am asking for donations and help to fund the trip,” he 
said. The young designer needs R85000 to pay for his gallery fee, visa and travelling costs.

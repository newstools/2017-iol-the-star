The singer, who is no stranger to the country, will give fans a taste of his hit singles when he lands in the country in November. In 2014, the musician performed at sold-out shows in both Joburg and Cape Town. Big Concerts confirmed that the All of Me singer will be performing in Joburg, Cape Town and Durban. Fans can expect to hear Legend perform new singles and all the older favourites. Legend’s album Love in the Future claimed the number 1 spot on the Billboard’s Hot 100 Singles Chart for All of Me. The song was also number 1 on the Urban AC, Top 40, Rhythm and Adult Top 40. The single marks Legend’s highest-selling and charting single of his career to date, with sales over 5.5 million worldwide. Legend will perform in Joburg on November 3 and 4 at the Ticketpro Dome, in Durban on November 7 at Moses Mabhida Stadium, and in Cape Town on November 9 and 10 at the Grand West Casino. Tickets go on sale from this Friday, starting at R375. - Staff Reporter

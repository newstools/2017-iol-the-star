The registration process, which began in March, had been halted in order to work out administration efficiency. “This process will ensure that new and old applications for low-cost housing are verified. Those who are not in the system but qualify will be registered on the national database of the housing needs register,” said city spokesperson Themba Gadebe. Officials will be working weekdays and on weekends to ensure that a large number of people are attended to. During the registration process, applicants are requested to bring along documents such as barcoded identity books or smart cards, birth certificates of dependants, marriage certificates if married, divorce decree and paysslips. Applicants must be older than 18. At the beginning of October, the registration process will be open to Ekurhuleni residents based in the northern region. The process will culminate with the eastern region. Residents are urged to visit their nearest customer care centre for more information. See graphics. @annacox

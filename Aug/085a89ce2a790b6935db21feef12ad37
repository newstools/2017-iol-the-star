This growth is the ambition driving the new Chinese ambassador to South Africa, Lin Songtian. He arrived at OR Tambo International Airport yesterday and wasted no time outlining his plans to foster and improve diplomatic ties between the two countries. “It is my great honour to be able to serve as the Chinese ambassador to South Africa at this important time, as both of our countries move to further economic transformation. “I feel the tremendous responsibility entrusted on me by the Chinese government and the Chinese people. I will spare no effort in fulfilling my mission,” Lin said. He added that he will use his role as ambassador to follow the principles of sincerity, practical results, affinity and good faith as advocated by China’s President Xi Jinping. China is South Africa’s biggest trading partner. It is also a major investor in the economy. In December 2014, President Jacob Zuma hosted Xi, stating that the country would remain in a solid partnership with China. Public Administration Minister Faith Muthambi in June touched on the political and economic relationship between the countries, saying the government thrives on ensuring that the partnership is strengthened. She also announced that up to 30 public officials would be travelling to China in November for training. This, she said, was part of the government’s memorandum of understanding with China. With high-level meetings having taken place, Lin has vowed to build on the plans that his native country has for South Africa.

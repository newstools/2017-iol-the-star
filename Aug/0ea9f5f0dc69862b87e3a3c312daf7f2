Khoza, a member of the basic education portfolio committee, was travelling to conduct oversight visits at various schools when the accident occured. The ANC’s Nomalungelo Gina, DA’s Ian Ollis and UDM’s Cynthia Majeke were injured, and were rushed to the Paarl Medi-Clinic. Gina is chairperson of the portfolio committee. ER24 said when paramedics arrived at the scene, the vehicle carrying the MPs was on its roof at the side of the road. A minibus taxi was found in the middle of the road facing oncoming traffic. “Eight other patients were found on the scene with injuries ranging from minor to serious. They were treated and the seriously injured provided with advanced life support,” ER24’s Russel Meiring said. Parliament expressed shock at the incident and sent condolences. “We convey our deepest condolences to the family of Comrade Khoza, the ANC as well as his fellow members and staff who worked with him,” said Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli. Tsenoli, who visited the other MPs in hospital, said “thoughts and prayers” were also with the trio and the occupants of the other vehicle involved in the crash for their speedy recovery. Khoza died “in the line of duty, serving his country and his people”, said ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa. IFP chief whip Narend Singh said: “On behalf of our leader, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, MP, we extend our heartfelt condolences.” DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said his party was “shocked and deeply saddened”.

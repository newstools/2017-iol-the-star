And this time, the entity is replacing all the old cables which keep getting stolen, with new cables that have no value on the black market. The ward’s proportional representative councillor Botshelo Moloisane said he had conducted an oversight visit to assess the street light situation. He was accompanied by City Power contractors. “Together we discovered that cable theft is the actual cause of the street lights not working. The cables were stolen from inside the poles. “The main roads of Slovoville are now being prioritised for street light repairs in a concerted effort to reduce criminal activities in the area. The City of Joburg will continue to work closely with City Power to ensure that repairs are carried out with urgency,” Moloisane said. He encouraged residents to support the efforts to build a safer and better Slovoville community by reporting cable theft. The tip-off line for City Power is 08000032 51. - Anna Cox

One of the first schools to enter was Jeppe High School for Girls, in Kensington. Principal Dina Gonçalves said the reasons for entering the competition are threefold. “Getting an education is not just about what is covered in the academic syllabus: we want our girls to have a wide knowledge of current affairs and to expose them to what is happening in the world,” said Gonçalves. She also wants to encourage learners to read newspapers especially because The Star and the school share the same long standing age. Gonçalves said: “We believe that every girl who matriculates leaves as a young woman ready to take on the world’s challenges “Competitions are good tools to enhance learning and are a lot of fun and we hope our girls win the competition. “The girls participate in a number of academic programmes, competitions and Olympiads each year. Moreover, the school develops its learners’  humility, gentleness and compassion through community involvement and over the last three years, we have donated over 1900 handmade blankets to the community via the ‘67 Blankets for Nelson Mandela Day’ project.” The winning school will take home R20000 and a Varsity College bursary worth R150000. Each team member will win R2000. The runner-up school will get R10000 and each team member will pocket R1000. The quiz will be held in September. The Star encourages schools in Joburg to enter.

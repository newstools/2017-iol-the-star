Johannesburg - Protesters set alight a Rea Vaya bus station, and blocked roads with burning tyres and rocks near Riverlea, Johannesburg, on Monday morning. Motorists around the Roodepoort and Soweto areas were urged to find alternatives routes.    Joburg Metro Police Department  spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said that Main Reef and Commando roads were barricaded with burning tyres and rocks.    He said that the protesters earlier hurled rocks and stones at passing motorists but now the affected routes have been blocked off.
“Traffic is now being diverted and we urge motorists to avoid the area," he said.     Minnaar said that a group of around 100 people from the Zamimpilo Informal Settlement near Riverlea began protesting  around 4am over service delivery issues in the area.
No arrests have been made yet.

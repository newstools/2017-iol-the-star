Those who were with her at Ayepyep Lifestyle Lounge took to social media to say the issue had nothing to do with drinks, blessers or being required to pay with her body, as many have suggested. According to the police, she came out of the club and approached a Mercedes Benz Viano with four people inside. “Reports suggest that shortly thereafter, the victim found her way into the vehicle, which led to an argument because she was reportedly not welcomed by the other occupants,” spokesperson Daniel Mavimbela said. He said the suspect had produced a handgun and shot the woman on the head before fleeing. He was arrested soon afterwards. But Rachel Maifala said on social media: “There was no argument inside Ayepyep; the ladies were not with those guys, and they paid their bill and called Uber. “When they got outside into the Uber, the meter taxi guys pulled them out and the Uber guy left; so they were left stranded. That’s when they saw the Viano guys. “She knows the owner of the car, then approached and got inside. He then asked his friend to take them out of the car since he was with other girls.” Maifala claimed Ledwaba had refused and one of the men, unaware that there were bullets in the barrel, had tried to scare them out of the car and the gun had gone off. He had promptly handed himself to the police, she said. But others insisted Ledwaba had been “blessed” by the man, who called her outside when he left and ordered her into his car. She had  refused and he had shot her, they alleged.

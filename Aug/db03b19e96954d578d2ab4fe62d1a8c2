Basa managing director Cas Coovadia said yesterday Mkhwebane did not realise the extent of the damage she caused to the economy when she released her report three months ago to change the mandate of the SA Reserve Bank. The rand tanked when the report was released and caused panic in the market. Coovadiaâ€™s comment, together with that of Parliament, came after the high court in Pretoria issued a scathing judgment against her. The judgment said Mkhwebane had no mandate to order Parliament to change the mandate of the SARB. The court said she exceeded her powers and this was reflected in the views of Sarb governor Lesetja Kganyago and Speaker Baleka Mbete. Coovadia said the judgment had whipped her into line and restored the independence of the SARB. - Staff Reporter

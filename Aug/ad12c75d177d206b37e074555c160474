This is the second Africa Youth Awards list that has been released. It aims to honour young achievers across the continent. President of the awards, Prince Akpah, said this year’s list had 45 women and 55 men. “This is a great move to inspire more young women in Africa and across the world to reach out for their dreams,” Akpah said. The top 100 are selected with a criterion that the honourees are between 15 and 36 years old. The judging panel is 
made up of young Africans from across the continent after 
public nominations are received and reviewed. The list covers people from 28 countries. Nigeria has the most honourees with 19, while South Africa came second with 18. Ghana was third with 10 and Kenya came in fourth with seven. Profiles of all the honourees can be viewed on www.africa-

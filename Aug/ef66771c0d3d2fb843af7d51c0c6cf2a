Johannesburg - Chris Hani's murderer Janusz Walus has been denied parole after Minister Michael Masutha's appeal of his parole was upheld in the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). Earlier this year, the Pretoria High Court decided to grant Walus parole after 21 years behind bars for Hani's murder in April 1993. The minister appealed the parole judgment after the victim impact statement by Hani's wife, Limpho, was not placed before Masutha and Walus, and thus not considered. However, no cost order was given by the SCA  because it was not his fault that the statement had not been disseminated in the manner envisaged by the act. The Act in question is section 6(2) Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000. The SCA found that the irregularity of not submitting Limpho Hani's victim impact statement impaired the parole decision. The court sent the decision back to Masutha for his consideration on whether Walus should, indeed, be granted parole; taking into account Limpho's victim impact statement and Walus' response thereto. This is if Walus intends responding to the statement. Walus, alongside the late Conservative Party leader Clive Derby-Lewis, killed Hani in the driveway of his Dawn Park, Ekurhuleni, home in April 1993 in what was believed to be a murder to stoke a racial war a year before the country's first democratic elections. Derby-Lewis, who supplied Walus with the murder weapon and was the mastermind of this gruesome crime, died in November last year. He was 80. The Star

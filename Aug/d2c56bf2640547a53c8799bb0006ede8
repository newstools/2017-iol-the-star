“It should be important to talk about the issues facing women, especially now with women being abused and killed being in the spotlight,” said the 5FM DJ. Thabethe, who is also an actress,  said the initiative was aimed at restoring the voices and power of women, while also celebrating their strides and efforts on Women’s Day. Officially called the Thando Thabethe Women’s Day Netball Challenge, it will focus on the message “Make It Stop”, the theme of the event. The goal is to reiterate the importance of speaking out and not being a bystander. “The challenge doesn’t just belong to me, it’s a community effort that belongs to all women. I aim to speak to the hearts and minds of all people, not just women. The femicide cases keep growing in numbers and it is up to us not to be bystanders,” said Thabethe. All teams will be put to the test during various heats, where they will go head to head until the winning team is crowned. The top three teams will win prizes. Every year, proceeds from the challenge go towards an organisation, and this year Nisa Homes will receive the money. Nisa is a transitional shelter for abused women and children. Celebrities who will be involved in the challenge on August 9 include Generations: The Legacy actress Manaka Ranaka, Selimathunzi presenter Khanya Mkangisa, presenter Boity Thulo, Idols judge Somizi Mhlongo and soccer star Jimmy Tau. To launch the occasion, Thabethe will be hosting a lunch - themed “The Beauty of being a Woman” - on Saturday with former public protector advocate Thuli Madonsela as special guest.

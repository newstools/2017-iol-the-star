The health checks took place yesterday at Meriting Village, an informal settlement south of Joburg. The purpose was to examine the elderly community’s health and to encourage them to look after themselves. The Winnie Mabaso Foundation is an NGO based in Meriting and was started two years ago. Amanda Mitchell, manager of the foundation, said their organisation consists of 35-40 elderly people. “We visit the grannies every Wednesday to spend time with them or give them a meal or meet any needs they may have. They are aware that we are here to help them,” she told The Star. One of the organisation’s driving factors was to get the elderly out of their homes to curb depression. They also visit the elderly when they are not feeling well. Mitchell said their foundation was also involved in building shacks, planting vegetable gardens, a library and pre-school projects in the settlement. Mapula Mandeno, a nurse at Clinix, encouraged the pensioners to always be vigilant of their health and to go for regular check-ups at their local clinic, and to always monitor this vital aspect of their lives. One of the old people happy about the initiative was Esther Montsi, 73, who said she was as strong as an ox. “I’m very happy with these proceedings and the time that the people from the clinic take to come and examine us. I think it’s important for us to know where we stand with regard to our health,” she said. Montsi said she was strong because she doesn’t smoke or drink. She also attributed her strength to the fact that she has not been intimate with anyone else since her husband died 25 years. Piet Maseko, 84, on the other hand, received unpleasant news. His blood pressure was irregularly high. He made a vow that he would look after himself better by honouring his clinic visits. Lebogang Matseke, communication manager of the Clinix Health Group, said the day was a success and she was happy with the turnout.

ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said yesterday the move by the DA was a regime change agenda and they wanted to subvert democracy. “This planned motion by the DA shows that the DA does not respect our democracy and the electorate of South Africa,” said ANC caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli. Mhlauli said they would defeat this motion by the DA, as they had defeated previous motions to overthrow the ANC government. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said they would table the motion calling for the dissolution of Parliament in line with the constitution. Maimane said after failure by the ANC this week to support them and remove President Jacob Zuma, they wanted Parliament to be dissolved and early polls be held. Parliament's spokesperson Moloto Mothapo declined to comment. “We are not in a position to respond as we have not received any communication from the party.” Maimane said holding early polls was the only way to remove Zuma. Maimane said they will still talk to other parties.

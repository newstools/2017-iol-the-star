Johannesburg - A Gauteng man who has struck lucky twice on the PowerBall game has come forward to claim his winnings. The man, who prefers to stay anonymous, bought two winning tickets from two different stores in Johannesburg. He is a regular lottery player and since Ithuba was established, he has always put his trust in specific numbers and had faith that one day, those particular numbers will help him.  On the day of the PowerBall draw, which took place on 24 March 2017, the jackpot had four winning tickets each worth R7.6 million and the lucky engineer walked away with a grand R15.2 million. In total, he played for R90; the first winning ticket was bought at a One Stop Spar in Kempton Park where he played for R45 and the second winning ticket was purchased at a supermarket in Brakpan and played for another R45.  The winner says he will invest most of his winnings in his retirement and settle all of his debt. He was one of the many affected by the Johannesburg floods. His car was swept by the floods and therefore called his winnings a 'miracle'. "I can now pay off the debt I had incurred for the new vehicle and also help those in need around me.‚Äù  He still finds his luck and R15.2 million winnings unbelievable and it is the biggest win that he has ever had. "My wife and I still wake up in the middle of the night in disbelief."  Ithuba congratulated the winner that obtained this rare win, one that the lottery operator has not seen before. But the lottery winnings does not mean that he will stop working and says he plans to retire at a later stage on the coast. The winner advises that players should not stop trying to win, on the condition that they are able to afford it and play responsibly. IOL adapted from press release

Family of the woman say she recalled how she was brutally beaten by three males and two females in a taxi before being dumped and left for dead in Worcester. Edwina Presence, 37, left her home on Saturday at about 9am to do shopping in Maitland, but never returned. The mother of five has been left traumatised and could only briefly explain what had happened to her husband and mother late on Monday when they went to see her in hospital. Police had contacted the family to say they found a woman in Paarl hospital who might be Edwina. Husband Quinton and Edwina’s mother headed to the hospital on Monday evening, as the rest of the family anxiously waited for word from the hospital. Edwina’s frantic 17-year-old daughter contacted the Daily Voice on Tuesday and confirmed that her mother had been found alive, but had been hurt and was still traumatised. “My mother said she got into a Bellville taxi in Maitland because the route allows her to get to 12th Avenue in Kensington,” the teen explained. “The taxi passed her stop and she got really frightened and panicked. Three men [one of them the driver] and two women started beating her up. “They took her bank card and her phone and dumped her on a field in Worcester. “They thought she was dead. That is how badly she was beaten. “A woman found her on the road and took her to hospital.” The ordeal has been a nightmare for her as the eldest child, as well as her little siblings who do not understand where their mother has gone. “I am so grateful my mother is alive and will be coming home soon. I can’t wait. I knew she would never leave us for anything. I missed her so much,” says the relieved girl. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andrè Traut says the vigilant work of police officers had paid dividends. “The mother from Kensington who was reported missing has been found. The circumstances surrounding the matter are still under investigation,” was all he could say. Daily Voice

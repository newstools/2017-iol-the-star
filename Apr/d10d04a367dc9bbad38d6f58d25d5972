The busy Eisleben Road in Mitchells Plain was the scene of carnage on Thursday night following a massive head-on collision which left two of the alleged car thieves dead and their car, a white VW Polo, mangled beyond 
recognition. Miraculously, the driver of the Isuzu bakkie into which they crashed suffered only a few scratches. It is believed the people in the Polo had been fleeing from police. Cops confirmed the Polo was reported stolen in Cape Town. Witnesses say the high-speed car chase, “that looked like a scene from The Fast and The Furious movie”, came to a crashing halt after the Polo jumped a red robot. They collided with a delivery bakkie from Ram Couriers, catapulting them to the side of the road. While the bakkie’s driver was not seriously injured, two men in the Polo died, while the two females with them were taken to hospital for treatment. Police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Andrè Traut, confirmed the incident. Traut said: “This office can confirm that the circumstances surrounding a culpable homicide vehicle accident on Thursday night at around 7:30pm on the corner of Silversands and Eisleben roads, Mitchells Plain, are being investigated after a VW Polo, which was reported stolen in Cape Town, collided with an Isuzu LDV. “Two male occupants in the Polo succumbed due to injuries and two female occupants sustained injuries and are being treated in hospital under police guard. The driver of the Isuzu sustained minor injuries.” Meanwhile, as the upcoming Easter break approaches, Western Cape Traffic Chief Kenny Africa says their intention this weekend is to reduce ongoing road carnage by strictly enforcing laws. Traffic officials will be setting up a number of roadblocks, focusing on vehicle roadworthiness, drunk driving and driver fatigue. Last weekend, 18 people died on the province’s roads. Daily Voice

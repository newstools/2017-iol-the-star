Johannesburg â€“ The sentencing hearing for disgraced former youth league leader Patrick Wisani began at the South Gauteng High Court on Monday. Wisani, 32, was convicted in November last year of murdering his then 24-year-old girlfriend Nosipho Mandleleni. The case, which has been ongoing for almost two years, has been delayed on several occasions due to Wisani assaulting witnesses, Siphokazi Mandleleni and her friend, where bail was then revoked . On Monday morning the court gallery was packed with members of the Yeoville Bellvue No Gender Based Violence coalition, who have been with the case since it began. The court heard testimony from Nosipho's mother Noxolo, who stated she would like to forgive Wisani but he had not admitted to committing the crime. "This thing has hurt me deeply. I would like to forgive him, but he has not admitted to commiting the crime. The wound in my heart will never heal," Noxolo said. She asked that the court hand down a sentence of life imprisonment to Wisani. Wisani, who was clad in a black jacket,white shirt and black trousers seemed relaxed as the arguments before sentencing were being heard. The hearing is still under way. The Star

On Monday Matsatsantsa a Pitori were drawn to take on Amakhosi in the quarterfinal at the FNB Stadium. Chiefs coach Steve Komphela welcomed the draw but admitted it was a tough one. “We will take it as it comes against SuperSport and maybe we’re saving the best (Soweto derby against Orlando Pirates) for last,” Komphela joked. “Stuart (Baxter, the SuperSport coach) has our DNA and most of the players at SuperSport have been with us (previously). They lost just two matches and we lost three, so the statistics are pretty close and both teams are chasing the championship (Absa Premiership title).” While Amakhosi made it to this stage of the competition by scraping past lower division side Acornbush United, Matsatsantsa had the equivalent of a stroll in the park as they beat KwaDukuza United 2-0. With Jomo Cosmos the only lower division side remaining in the competition, the draw dished out what could be some tightly-contested ties. Pirates will get to play at home for the first time in the tournament when they welcome Bloemfontein Celtic, while Golden Arrows will host Platinum Stars. Cosmos will travel to the Eastern Cape for a date with Chippa United. Dates and venues of the matches are yet to be announced.

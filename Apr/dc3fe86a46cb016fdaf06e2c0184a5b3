Lorraine Gilles has filed a defamation lawsuit against the former Spice Girls star, in which she hit back at claims in the America’s Got Talent star’s divorce documents that she and Mel’s husband, Stephen Belafonte, had been “pilfering money” from her, had an affair and terminated a pregnancy after conceiving Belafonte's baby. However, the former staff member - who is suing for defamation, libel, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress - claims Mel has portrayed her as a “homewrecker, prostitute and extortionist” but “in actuality” the Wannabe hitmaker “seduced” her as a “naive and curious 18-year-old foreign exchange student with alcohol, fame and casual sex”. Gilles states the 41-year-old singer - who has daughters Phoenix, 18, and Angel, 10, from past relationships and 5-year-old Madison with Belafonte - confided in her when she first came to the US from her native Germany and told her she and her spouse had an open relationship. Shortly afterwards, the trio had a threesome and Gilles claims she continued having sex with Mel for the next seven years. The nanny says she fell pregnant after a one-night stand and sought help from the former X Factor judge, who helped her arrange an abortion. She insists she doesn't have any sex tapes of them and when they did have sex, Mel would film the encounters and/or “take part in the menage a trois herself”.  - Bang Showbiz

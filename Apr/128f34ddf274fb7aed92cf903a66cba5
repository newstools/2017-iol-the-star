 Johannesburg - A section of the Braampark Building in Braamfontein was left gutted after a blaze engulfed the upper level of the building on Tuesday afternoon. It is not yet clear what caused the fire but Johannesburg Emergency Services (JMS) confirmed that there were no casualties. JMS spokesperson Synok Matoboko said investigations would commence as soon as it was safe for investigators to enter the building. "The building that was on fire had five floors and the fire was on the top floor," he said. "The roof has collapsed so we searched if there was anyone trapped in the building and we didn't find anyone so the crew started with putting the fire out." Matoboko said the structural damage caused by the blaze would only be determined after investigators concluded their task.

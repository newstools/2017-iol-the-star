Johannesburg – Police are investigating a case of child negligence after a Katlehong baby, just a few weeks old, was found abandoned on the side of the road in the Ekurhuleni township. Police were made aware of the baby’s discovery by residents on Thursday. The baby boy, who was taken to hospital for treatment, was said to be in a stable condition. Police spokesperson Captain Mega Ndobe said: “The baby was found in a good condition and was later taken to hospital for a check-up.” Newly-appointed Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula went onto Twitter to plead for anyone with information regarding the baby boy’s parents to come forward and assist the police. “A baby estimated to be two to three weeks old was found abandoned at Katlehong South area by members of the community. If you know the mother, come forward by calling Crime Stop on 0860010111. Katlehong FCS (unit) is investigating the case,” Mbalula tweeted. Despite there being no statistics quantifying the number of abandoned children, reports have suggested that around 3 500 youngsters are abandoned annually. This translates to around 300 children a month. In her 2014 research paper for the University of the Witwatersrand, titled "Sad, Bad and Mad", Deirdre Elizabeth Blackie said 65% of abandoned children are newborns, 90% of whom are under the age of one. She further said 70% of children are abandoned in unsafe areas which include toilets, drains, sewers and gutters. The Star

Fedusa instructed its attorneys Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr Incorporated to issue a letter of demand to Saftu steering committee convenor Zwelinzima Vavi to change their name, or face legal action. Fedusa is objecting to Saftu’s name because it “closely resembles” theirs. Saftu registered with the Labour Department last month and its new name, chosen ahead of two others, is expected to be ratified at its congress this weekend. Vavi confirmed having received correspondence from Fedusa’s attorneys, but had written back dismissing this demand. He insisted that the name was “absolutely nothing close” to their rival’s name.

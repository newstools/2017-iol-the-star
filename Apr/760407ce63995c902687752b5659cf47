RENOWNED South African boxing trainer Nick Durandt died in a motorbike accident near Clarens in the Free State on Friday.  He was 53.  A larger-than-life character, known as much for his chains and rings as for his ability to produce champion boxers, Durandt produced a number of winners on the South African and international scene.  Among his more famous charges include Thulani “Sugarboy” Malinga, Philip “The Timebomb” Ndou, Cassius Baloyi, Silence Mabuza and Hawk Makepula.  One of the biggest days of his career would’ve been preparing Ndou for the massive showdown against the mighty Floyd Mayweather junior in 2003 in Michigan, with “Money” taking the honours with three powerful overhand rights in the seventh round to win on a technical knockout as the referee stopped the fight.  Durandt was also part of the Hasim Rahman camp when the American knocked out Lennox Lewis at Carnival City in 2001.  Durandt retired in May last year and still maintained a few gyms in Johannesburg until his death.    IOL   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter

 THERE’S no mistaking Kim Kardashian as she takes to the beach on a holiday in Mexico. The 36-year-old American reality TV star, who was robbed at gunpoint in a Paris hotel six months ago, showed off her famous curves in the resort of Tulum on the Atlantic coast. She wore a patterned bikini with red, yellow and green trim, accessorised with hoop ear-rings and a gold necklace, plus mirrored shades to keep the sun out of her eyes. The mother of two, who is married to US rapper Kanye West, 39, appeared confident as she walked through the waves. But in the past she has been open about the way she looks. ‘I have cellulite, just like almost every other woman on the planet. And just because I feel secure with my body doesn’t mean I think cellulite is cute,’ she confessed to Shape magazine in 2010. ‘It will always be an issue for me. So let’s just say it’s a work in progress.’ © Daily Mail

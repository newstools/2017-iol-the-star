 Hunter Tilling’s family and friends are now desperately asking the public, through the Facebook page “Help Hunter Tilling”, for any information on the accident, as well as to help fund her medical bills.  Spokesperson for the family, Bridget Studzinski, told The Independent on Saturday that Tilling, 23, was between jobs – about to start her dream job in interior design on Tuesday – when the accident happened, and also between medical aids and therefore not covered. The bills have already exceeded the R350 000 that has been raised. Studzinski said Tilling underwent a five-hour operation after being admitted to uMhlanga Hospital and needs two more brain operations. “Doctors were trying to lift her off her sedation medication but when they did it again today she was coughing and became restless,” said Studzinski. “So they had to sedate her again so that she could rest more. She is strong-willed and will need rest to help her heal.” Tilling also suffered a break to the lower back, said Studzinski. Independent on Saturday

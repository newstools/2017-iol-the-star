Pretoria - The Hawks have arrested a 23-year-old male for allegedly plotting to assassinate officials perceived as state capture beneficiaries.  In October 2016, the anti-corruption unit intercepted communication material of possible assassinations which were being planned where various members from the cabinet, state owned entities and prominent South African were listed as targets.  The Hawks acted upon the information received and conducted undercover operations in Pretoria and Johannesburg which lead to the arrest of a-23-year-old man.  The suspect and a founding member of the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance (ASCDSA) was arrested on April 26 in Midrand while he was busy explaining to the donors how the assassination of state capture beneficiaries was going to be carried out by the undercover coup plot snipers.  Almost 19 individuals were targeted and their names will only be divulged in court.  The communication intercepted by the investigators included various letters which were sent to selected companies to donate money at a total amount of R140-million to fund the alleged clandestine operation.  During the ongoing investigation, another group, the Anti-White Monopoly Capitalists Regime (AWMCG) surfaced.  It was discovered that the AWMCG used the same operandi soliciting donations in order to assassinate senior government officials and other South African citizens.  A search was conducted at the suspect's home and evidentiary proof was confiscated for further investigations. It further transpired that there were other companies he solicited funds from using same modus operandi.  The suspect is expected to appear before Johannesburg Magistrate Court on April 28 to face conspiracy to commit murder and other charges. Bail will be opposed to allow further investigation.  IOL

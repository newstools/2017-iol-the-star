Van Breda is appearing in the Western Cape High Court for allegedly murdering his father, mother and brother. He also faces a charge of attempted murder for the axe attack on his sister, who survived with serious brain injuries. The wealthy family were attacked in their home in the De Zalze Estate outside Stellenbosch in January 2015. Marli van Breda is expected to be a key witness in the trial of her brother. Henri van Breda also faces a charge of defeating the ends of justice, for allegedly giving police false information during the investigation. He first told police that his family was attacked by an axe-wielding intruder and it was reported that Van Breda himself exhibited superficial wounds, which included knife wounds. But more than a year after the killings, the 22-year-old handed himself over to police. IOL

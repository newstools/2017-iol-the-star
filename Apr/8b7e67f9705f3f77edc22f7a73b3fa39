“Ntlemeza must understand that wherever he is this is not KC and Jojo. This isn’t a movie. We are running a country.” “Robert McBride was once suspended, did he go to Pastor Mboro? Did he mobilise the masses?” “This is not Bold and Beautiful, we are running a country, Ntlemeza was not voted, we were voted.” “He is accelerating, he is doing 300km/* . Even a Ferrari doesn’t do 300km/* ." “Ntlemeza is not defying me. Me and him can box in the street. This is not about me and him.” “General #Ntlemeza has basically showed us the middle finger. He said I’m useless. Other things I won’t tell you.” “It seems we’ve exhausted the questions, I’m getting emotional, it seems I need some prayer from Pastor Mboro as well.” “How was Ntlemeza allowed to enter this place? He is not a journalist. He has no authority to command anyone.” “I don’t think he has any political backing, but I think he thinks he does.”

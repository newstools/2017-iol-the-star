It is understood that the woman, in her late 30s, was leaving her home when she was accosted by two men in her driveway at about 5pm. They forced their way into her car and drove her around the city for about two hours. The men apparently took turns driving and while one took the wheel, the other raped her. Eventually, they let her go in Wentworth. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that a case of hijacking and rape was opened at Pinetown police station. “A 37-year-old victim was hijacked of her vehicle in New Germany,” he said. “It is alleged that the victim was approached by two suspects who pointed a firearm at her and jumped into her vehicle.” Zwane said they drove off with the woman in the car. “It is alleged that she was raped by both suspects before they dropped her in the Wentworth area,” he said. No arrests had, as of on Sunday afternoon, been made and the woman’s vehicle had not yet been recovered. The area has recently seen a spike in violent crime and residents recently told The Mercury that they feared that the crimes would escalate to rape and murder. Last month, a Westville mother was threatened with rape during a violent home invasion by a gang of heavily-armed men, who forced her husband and son to drive them to Clermont after holding the family hostage.

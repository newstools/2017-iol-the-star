France Manaka, 26, and Cosmos Ntanzi, 30, received bail of R50000, while Simon Thokwane, 37, was granted bail of R100000. The trio face charges of armed robbery with aggravated circumstances. Manaka is a vault supervisor for Guard Force International a private security company that specialises in moving high-risk cargo. Ntanzi is a metered taxi owner who allegedly knew details of the heist beforehand, and who is thought to have given one of the robbers a ride to an Engen garage. Thokwane, a police constable stationed at the airport, allegedly showed the robbers access points and helped them observe the movements of security and police personnel based there. Manaka and Ntanzi’s bail conditions required them to report to the nearest police station daily except on Thursdays and Fridays. Thokwane has to report to his nearest police station daily from Monday to Friday, and twice on Saturday and Sunday. Magistrate Amukelani Msimeki said the trio’s bail conditions prevented them from leaving the province without the investigating officer’s written permission. Msimeki also said the only aspect which weighed against their being granted bail was the admission statements they made during their arrests. “There is nothing before me that suggests otherwise and the court has come to the conclusion that the exceptional circumstances permit the release of all six accused,” Msimeki said. On Monday the court granted bail to their co-accused Sibusiso Mnisi, 39, Prince Dube, 43, and Thando Sonqishe, 39. Mnisi a maintenance worker at Guard Force International, got bail of R50000, while businessmen Dube got bail of R150000 and Sonqishe R100000. The seventh suspect, Mosiwa Mutame, 35, was released after he handed himself over to police. The group is alleged to have been involved in robbing and getting away with R20.7 million at the airport on March 7. The matter was postponed to May 26 for further investigation. @tankmaester

Johannesburg - Chaos erupted in Joburg's CBD on Friday as ANC members, who were marching towards where the DA had assembled, were dispersed with rubber bullets by police. The march is one of many planned around the country after President Jacob Zuma’s cabinet reshuffle last week during which Pravin Gordhan was fired as finance minister, prompting an investment status downgrade to “junk” by ratings agency Standard and Poor’s. The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department, together with SAPS, fired rubber bullets at ANC members who were careering down Commissioner Street, heading towards Newtown where DA members were gathering for the protests.    An ANC member who was shot in his right calf by a rubber bullet, told Independent Media that they wanted to "quietly engage" DA members, but decided not to when they saw the heavy police presence around Newtown.    "So we decided to head towards Mandela Bridge (in Newtown and Braamfontein) to go and peacefully protest at a place named after our father," the member, who asked to remain anonymous, explained. "But the police decided to continue shooting at us saying: 'Why do you want to go to Mandela Bridge?' We had no choice but to run for cover. I, unfortunately, was shot, including a few of my comrades." The 35-year-old man from Ward 67 in Yeoville, Joburg, asserted that he would not be deterred from continuing his protest because "they did worse things to Chris Hani!"  khaya.koko@inl.co.za  @khayakoko88 The Star

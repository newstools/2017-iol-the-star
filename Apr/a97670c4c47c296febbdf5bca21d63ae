Dlodlo told The Star on Sunday she was going to meet with the interim board on Tuesday following her meeting with former Communications Minister, Faith Muthambi. Muthambi and Dlodlo met in Pretoria on Sunday for the official handover following a cabinet reshuffle on Thursday night. The chairperson of the SABC interim board, Khanyisile Kweyama, confirmed they would meet Dlodlo. However, Kweyama did not want to discuss further issues regarding the SABC until the interim board had met Dlodlo. This followed the meeting of the board on Sunday. Dlodlo also said she would meet with other entities falling under her portfolio. “On Tuesday I am going to meet the chairs and CEOs of entities under my responsibility. And thereafter I will meet with the entities individually.” Before she was moved to Public Service and Administration, ex-minister Faith Muthambi had ordered the interim board to stop its meetings until it had received security clearance. But she has since been moved, and her successor is yet to meet the interim board. Dlodlo is also expected to meet with the portfolio committee on communications after Parliament resumes its business in May. Departments and entities will be presenting their budgets in Parliament next month. The strategic plans of departments and entities inform their plans for the next three years and how they intend to implement the plans and spend their budgets. The SABC is in deep financial crisis, with reports that it has burnt cash and is unable to pay some of the service providers. Unions were up in arms last month over plans to retrench some SABC staff members because of the cash crisis. The public broadcaster last month blamed some of the people who gave evidence in the ad hoc committee into the inquiry on the SABC for costing it business. It said some of the business partners had ditched it because of the things said at the Parliamentary inquiry. The interim board has been urged by Parliament to fix the public broadcaster. The Star

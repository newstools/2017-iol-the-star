They care about none of their clients and they seem to make it quite clear with their don’t-care attitude; but they fail to realise they’re nothing without their client base because it’s us that made them into a multibillion-rand service provider and, if we were to abandon them, perhaps they’d realise it. I usually don’t check my balances, as I receive my bundles on the 12th of each month; but in March I checked, only to realise that MTN hadn’t loaded my airtime, only the internet bundle was loaded. I called 808 on the very same day and had lodged a ticket stating they don’t see my airtime loaded, hence they acknowledged it from their side, and said I should phone back in a day or two, which I did - only to hear excuses. They’ve lodged a total of seven tickets and somehow say they did load my airtime but I refused to accept what they’ve said as there isn’t proof and my bundle balance remained unchanged. I waited for April 12 and checked my balances, only to see that once again only my data bundle was loaded; and, when I tried to check for my airtime, it kept on showing an error. It’s truly frustrating! They clearly just want money but can’t provide a proper service.

Just another way for them to take our money.  I’d never recommend MTN to anyone; they should be degraded and shamed. M Doorgha  Georgie: I sent the complaint to MTN’s press office, which yet again failed to respond to consumers or media. CAPE ARGUS

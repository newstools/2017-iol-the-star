I was flooded last year and everything got destroyed. I can t let this happen again. &quot;I m worried about flooding and what these winds will do to my house and to my family, he said.WATCH: #Dineo kills at least 7 as it pummels MozambiqueKomane said he has a wife and four children who he needs to protect.

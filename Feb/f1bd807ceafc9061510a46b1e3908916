Johannesburg Despite havoc erupting in Parliament during the State of The Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday night, the 11-year-old praise singer who performed through it said he had one of the best nights of his life. Given Lubisi told The Star on Sunday he had sleepless nights anxiously waiting to praise President Jacob Zuma before he delivered his address, but the experience turned out to be nothing short of amazing. He was not perturbed at all by the commotion which took place when Zuma walked into Parliament and the EFF loudly chanted tsotsi (thief).This, however, was not the only chanting that happened. The ANC then started screaming ANC to try and drown the noise the EFF were making. This almost took Lubisi s shine away as the focus now shifted to the chanting. Lubisi said he knew there would be drama but this was not going to take away his excitement. I was not scared or angry at what happened on Thursday night. I know there is competition and drama between the political parties, I made sure I had fun and that it was not going to take away from my shine, he said. He said his whole night was filled with excitement as it was his first time in Parliament. It was a great privilege to praise the President, but it was also exciting to be in Parliament. I am so young and having such an experience made me so happy. Given s father, Erick, said his son was not bothered at all and did his very best despite all happening around him. He said this was not the first time his son was asked to be a praise singer. He praised the MECs and the Mpumalanga premier when he delivered the State of the Province Address in 2016. Erick, who is also a praise singer, said his son s praise singing is a gift from God because he was not taught by anyone although he always imitated him. He said he knew Given was ready for the national platform after successfully performing in Mpumalanga.The Star

Johannesburg It still remains unclear whether or not Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane will oppose President Jacob Zuma taking legal bid to take the State of Capture report on judicial review.Speaking on Xolani Gwala's show on Talk Radio 702 on Monday morning, Mkhwebane reasserted that her office was seeking legal opinion on whether they should oppose or support Zuma's application to take the State of Capture report on judicial review.&quot;Remember, the president is applying for review of the remedial action especially where the report is instructing him to appoint a judicial (commission of) inquiry but the judge should be appointed by the Chief Justice. Therefore, in our deliberations we want to make sure that we put our case very clear and it's well supported,&quot; she said.Asked by Gwala on whether or not she supports former public protector Thuli Madonsela's proposition for a judicial inquiry, Mkhwebane said: &quot;Yes, I support the proposition made by my predecessor as far as the judicial inquiry is concerned because the capacity constraints within the Public Protector South Africa (office).&quot;She also wanted to make it clear that she was not in Zuma's pocket and that she was her own person, saying: &quot;I am not favouring President Zuma. Everyone has watched the Parliamentary processes when I was nominated. I was there answering my own questions and South Africans are the ones who said (that) I can be the person who can perform.&quot; [email&#160;protected]The Star

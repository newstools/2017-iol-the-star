Johannesburg Letshego Zulu was one of the top awardees at the annual I Do Awards at the weekend, the fitness instructor receiving a silver honour for Most Inspirational Couple. Her late husband, Gugu Zulu, died last year while the couple were attempting to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to raise awareness of the plight of undeprivileged girls who often cannot afford sanitary pads.Zulu said she respected the union she shared with Gugu and was very patient with him as they got married only after 13 years of dating. People rush into these things without having their heads firmly on their shoulders. I only wish people could have shared and experienced a little bit of what I did, she said.She said Felicia Buthelezi was one of the people who had believed in her and Gugu s love for many years.Mrs SA first princess Olwethu Leshabane, I Do Awards founder Felicia Buthelezi and presenter Benni Langa.

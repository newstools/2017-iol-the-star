Johannesburg The ANC in Gauteng has come out with guns blazing in support of embattled Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. Any moves to remove him from his crucial position would amount to scapegoating, it said. It also commended him for his sterling work in the national treasury.This as speculation intensified that Gordhan might be replaced by former Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe when President Jacob Zuma reshuffles his cabinet and after parliament announced Molefe would be sworn in as ANC MP on Monday or on Tuesday. ANC structures in the North West have revolted against the nomination of Molefe. An ANC MP said on Sunday it would not be an easy process to get Molefe sworn-in his arrival in Parliament brings a level of uncertainty.ANC chief whip in the Gauteng provincial legislature, Brian Hlongwa, said on Sunday after a caucus lekgotla in the city the ANC provincial executive committee did not agree with the youth league s call that Zuma redeploy Gordhan.Political Bureau

Johannesburg Following Sunday night s alleged xenophobic violence which broke out in the Jeppestown area and which spread to the corner of Main Reef Road and Jerusalem Street where foreign-owned shops were looted, the Joburg Metro Police Department says it is on high alert and is working closely with the SAPS in containing any possible xenophobic attacks. We have metro police officers on the ground feeding information back to the nerve centre, ready to deploy officers 24 hours a day, said City of Joburg s member of the mayoral committee for public safety Michael Sun. As part of the Gauteng Provincial Joint Operation Centre (JOC) the city is also working with SAPS and other law enforcement agencies to develop strategies and action plans to deal with xenophobic situations. Xenophobia and racism has no place in our society and it, along with the looting, intimidation and violence that are associated with these outbreaks, must be condemned in the strongest regard. As a pro-poor government, we advocate for a tolerant and inclusive society and it must be understood that the assault, looting and damage to property associated with these alleged xenophobic crimes, is nothing but acts of thuggery, he said. This issue must be placed squarely at the feet of national government, who must take an unmuddled stance on immigration policy implementation and also guarantee the safety of foreign nationals who contribute to the economy of the city, he said. National government also needs to be transparent as to the number of successful convictions and correctional measures imposed against xenophobic criminals. We encourage residents and community organisations to furnish us with information of any planned violence, and we will do our utmost best to contain the situation and ensure the safety of our residents and their businesses in the city, concluded Sun. @annacox [email&#160;protected] The Star

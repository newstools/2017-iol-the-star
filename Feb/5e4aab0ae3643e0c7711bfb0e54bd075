Johannesburg Controversial forensic consultant Paul O'Sullivan was arrested on Monday night allegedly on the same charge as his attorney, Sarah Jane Trent.Trent was taken into custody last week for allegedly impersonating an officer of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid). Afriforum CEO, Kallie Kriel confirmed that O'Sullivan was arrested on the same charges after a meeting at their offices. O'Sullivan was arrested outside the office building and immediately taken to Kameeldrift police station. I am at Kameeldrift police station with #PaulOSullivan Our legal team will be in court at 21:00 to ask for his release.

Kriel was also insistent that O'Sullivan had been granted a court order in November that police would have to give the forensic consultant at least 48 hours notice if he were to be arrested, an order that was alleged ignored by the SAPS on Monday night. Still confused as to why all this for 1 mans arrest? Right in front of my day job. #PaulOSullivan pic.twitter.com/ClfLsK9dSXStill confused as to why all this for 1 mans arrest?

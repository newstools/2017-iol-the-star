We made sure that the planning of budget is R4m for the event. We are trying as much as possible to improve on the way we do business, Mgidlana said. We try to make sure we do not deny the members and South Africans any services they need to get.&quot;&quot;When they get that service, it should be at a reduced cost.&quot; Our budget for Sona comes from quite a high and I think we are now at quite a low, Mgidlana said, adding that Parliament has tried to use various means to be efficient in the delivering of services.Political Bureau

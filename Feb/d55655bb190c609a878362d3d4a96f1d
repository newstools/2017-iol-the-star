Johannesburg Police have confirmed that two suspects linked to the murder of Khwesi Hudson, who was shot at the popular Soweto restaurant Sakhumzi last month, were due to appear in court on Wednesday. This comes after the pair were arrested on Tuesday morning. According to police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters, one of the suspects was arrested in KwaZulu-Natal and the other in Gauteng. The pair, aged 23 and 25, were due to appear in the Orlando Magistrate s Court on charges of murder, armed robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm. Police confiscated a firearm and a vehicle believed to have been used in the murder. Hudson, a manager at Sakhumzi, was killed in the early hours of a Sunday morning last month after a botched armed robbery. At the time of the incident, Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said the restaurant had closed for the evening and staff were busy cashing up when two men came to the entrance. The manager approached them to tell them that the restaurant was closed and they shot him several times after he refused to let them in. He died on the scene and the men fled the area following the shooting, Makhubele said.Shortly after the shooting, Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba said security in the tourist area around Vilakazi Street would need to be upgraded. The Sakhumzi tragedy is a countrywide problem. We must help these businesses succeed. We must make sure residents and tourists feel safe.&quot; We won t allow criminals to intimidate our businesses. People must come and support Sakhumzi without fear, Mashaba said.The Star

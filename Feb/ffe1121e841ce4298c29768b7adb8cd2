Johannesburg ANC communications manager Khusela Sangoni is thinking long and hard about leaving social media after President Jacob Zuma s daughter Thuthukile launched a scathing attack on her on Twitter at the weekend.Thuthukile, whose mother is former AU Commission chairperson Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, expressed unhappiness over a media statement that was supposedly issued by Sangoni.She wrote on Twitter: Khusela s statement bout (sic) ANCYL GP puts the ANC into disrepute. Unelected officials should not be writing statements on behalf of the org. In other posts she wrote: ANC must stop juniorising serious posts. The only spokesperson must be an elected NEC member not an employee. Thuthukile, 27, resigned as chief of staff in the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services a year ago. Her appointment was widely criticised as a result of her age and inexperience.Sangoni on Sunday posted on her Facebook page: Hey ingathi umntu ngekhe ayicingisise lento yokuphuma kule social media loosely translated as &quot;one has to seriously consider quitting social media&quot;.In another post, she uploaded selfies with the words: Junior not junior. Elected unelected. Yona leyo. On way to #ANCGP- Lekgotla we selfie anyway #IWokeUpLikeThis Hello World. Sangoni was unavailable for comment on Sunday night. @luyolomkentaneThe Star

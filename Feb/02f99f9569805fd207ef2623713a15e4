Johannesburg The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a warning for heavy rain in several parts of the country, including Gauteng where localised flooding is possible.Forecaster Elizabeth Webster told The Star on Monday morning that although a wet week was expected, most of the downpour was expected on Monday and Tuesday. This is when an 80 % chance of showers was expected, coupled with cool temperatures which will peak in the low to mid twenties. Other areas affected include the western parts of the North West, the central and northern parts of the Free State as well as the extreme northern parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Webster explained that the weather warning was issued for these two days as more than 50 millimetres of rain was expected in a period of just 24 hours. This amount of rainfall could result in flooding. She said that this was considered more than usual downpours as during an average thunderstorm, only three to four millimetres of water was usually recorded. Webster said although the wet weather was expected to continue until Sunday, the rainfall would decrease from Wednesday. From Wednesday the rainfall expected will drop to 60% and cool to warm temperatures are expected.

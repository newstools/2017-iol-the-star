Other areas majorly affected by traffic delays caused by the rain included parts of Gillooly s interchange in Ekurhuleni and Wemmerpan road in the south of Joburg. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a warning for heavy rain in several parts of the country, including Gauteng where localised flooding is possible. Forecaster Elizabeth Webster told The Star that although a wet week was expected, most of the downpours was expected on Monday and Wednesday. This is when an 80 % chance of showers was expected, coupled with cool temperatures which will peak in the low to mid twenties. Other areas affected include the western parts of the North West, the central and northern parts of the Free State as well as the extreme northern parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Webster explained that the weather warning was issued for these two days as more than 50 millimetres of rain was expected in a period of just 24 hours. This amount of rainfall could result in flooding. She said that this was considered more than usual downpours as during an average thunderstorm, only three to four millimetres of water is usually recorded. Webster said that although the wet weather is expected to continue until Sunday, the rainfall would decrease from Wednesday. From Wednesday the rainfall expected will drop to 60% and cool to warm temperatures are expected. Meanwhile, Webster said that a warning for strong gale force winds in the south west coast was issued today as well as a fire danger for the western parts of the Western Cape which is currently experiencing hot and dry weather. Authorities have consistently warned people to take warnings of heavy downpours seriously as recent rainfall has caused havoc in recent weeks. Joburg Emergency Management Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said that people should be high alert and prepare for possible floods around the city. He added that those living in low lying areas like the informal settlements to monitor water levels and move to the higher ground when there is a need to do so. We therefore urge our residents to be better prepared since we have received another alert from the South African Weather Services (SAWS) for the possibility of severe thunderstorms throughout the city of Johannesburg going into the weekend.

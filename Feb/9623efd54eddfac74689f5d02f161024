Johannesburg The ANC on Monday held a special national executive committee meeting in a bid to facilitate the party s preparation ahead of a meeting to be held in June to discuss documents in the ANC national policy. The party s senior executive members met in Pretoria to discuss, among other policies, the implementation of the radical economic transformation policy. However, recent media reports have suggested that Monday s meeting of the senior decision-making members would allegedly be used as a platform to discuss the ousting of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The reports have also suggested that this move would see the disgraced former Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe either replacing Deputy Minister of Finance Mcebisi Jonas or would see him ascend to head the ministry. This comes in the wake of the ANC Youth League, ANC Women s League and Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association calling on President Jacob Zuma to fire the minister, who they claim is blocking radical socio-economic transformation . In a statement released by the ruling party on Monday, the ANC said, however, the purpose of the meeting would be to consider discussing documents in the conference to be held in June. The Star

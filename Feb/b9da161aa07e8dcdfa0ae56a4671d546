Johannesburg Northriding and surrounding areas will be without water for the following three days. Joburg Water supply said on Tuesday morning that the interruptions are due to urgent repairs to a burst pipe on a major pipe line along Washington Drive. It said processes on the repair were already underway and technicians estimated that it might take up to 72 hours to complete. The pipe was damaged by a contractor, who was busy with pipe installation in the area. Johannesburg Water is also engaging the contractor to recover on losses of water and repair costs. This is because all contractors are required to obtain a way leave from JRA before they can work in the road reserve. Part of this process is to supply them with drawings of where our water and sanitation infrastructure is running, said spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene. Joburg Water said it apologises for the inconvenience to all affected consumers and appeal patience during this period. Consumers in the area not experiencing water shortages are urged to reduce consumption to immediate household needs to avoid rapid decline in available supply.

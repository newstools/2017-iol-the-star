Johannesburg A 36-year-old man was shot dead when he entered a Hillbrow store only to find a robbery in progress.Hillbrow police spokesperson Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo said the incident happened around 6pm on Wednesday on the corners of Twist and Goldreich Streets. Five armed suspects entered the supermarket pretending to be customers, one of the men stood outside to watch while the others ordered everyone in the store to lie down. They demanded money and airtime, taking an undisclosed amount of both, Zondo explained. A customer walked into the shop unaware of what was happening and when he realised he tried to exit the supermarket but the suspect outside saw him and shot him. He was shot once in the upper body and the suspects managed to get away, he said.ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said when they arrived on scene, paramedics found a large number of local law enforcement already in attendance.

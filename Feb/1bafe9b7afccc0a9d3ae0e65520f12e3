Johannesburg - Magistrate Paul du Plessis needed more time to read over bail affidavits before he could make a decision on whether the mother of a 3-year-old, and her boyfriend, who have been accused of murder, will be released on bail. In June last year, Kayden Smith* (not his real name) died after he had been put in a boiling hot bath.A source close to the case said the boy had been put into the bath by the boyfriend, while the mother was not at home, and when she returned home and saw the child in his bed, she discovered he had burns.Sixty percent of the three-year-old s body had burns.&nbsp;Hours later, the mother and boyfriend called an ambulance when they found he was unresponsive, a source claimed. The same source said the boy also seemed to have a fractured rib, and that he had been injured on previous occasions. The two were to have applied for bail last Wednesday.&nbsp;However, the application was postponed to Monday when both accused changed lawyers at the last minute. However, the couple will only hear on Tuesday whether they will be granted bail after Du Plessis finishes reading the affidavits. Multiple sources close to the case confirmed that the boy had been abused numerous times before the fatal burning. Meanwhile, the boyfriend seemed to have sustained injuries to his head while in custody. When he appeared before the court, he had a large bandage wrapped around his head. A family member, speaking before the proceedings, said his brother had been attacked in jail. @heidigiokosThe Star

Johannesburg - There are a lot of firsts for Malizole Hole this year. He started a new job in January and also took on the role of a father. The 26-year-old has had to make an adjustment to this new life. I have been studying for a while, I m still busy with my B-Tech. I took a gap year after school and started studying thereafter, he said. Hole said his current responsibilities had made him realise he has a lot to bear in mind. It definitely helps me focus more on work. Before this, I had been actively looking for jobs. Doing everything from emails to walk-ins, and I got my first break last year. Hole started his internship with a public relations firm at the beginning of the year. Before that, he had done some temporary work at a travel agency. He said that when the government spoke about job creation, it was something that only affected him on paper. The actual experience of job creation is something that I haven t felt. I m just a statistic. Hole said he did not see how the Budget speech would affect him directly.THE STAR

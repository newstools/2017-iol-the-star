Johannesburg - The Roodepoort Magistrate's court on Tuesday denied Kwaito star Sipho Charles "Brickz" Ndlovu's leave to appeal his rape conviction as well as 15-year sentence. The "Sweety My Baby" hitmaker was earlier sentenced to 15 years behind bars for the rape of his then 16-year-old niece. Brickz was arrested in November 2013 over the incident, which took place at his home in Ruimsig. He was then convicted of rape in July 2017. Magistrate John Baloyi, in rejecting the Kwaito star's application, said there was nothing shocking about the sentence handed down and said a high court would reach the same conclusion.

Baloyi, handing down judgment earlier on, said Brickz had betrayed the trust of close family members when he raped the victim. Baloyi also cited Ndlovu's lack of remorse over the crime, adding that this made him unsuitable for rehabilitation. IOL

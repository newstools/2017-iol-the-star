Prosecutor Andre Wilsenach told the court that Zinde had been evaluated by a panel of psychiatrists from Weskoppies Hospital and that their report regarding his mental state was ready. He said the report would be handed to court soon. It is understood that the case will yet again be postponed and that Zinde will go on trial only sometime next year. Yesterday was the first time that Zinde appeared in the high court, as he was under observation at Weskoppies for several months. Zinde, who had, during his previous appearance, shouted obscenities at some of the people in court, appeared calm yesterday. It is claimed that he killed his 50-year-old mother at their home in Pecanwood Estate, Hartbeespoort Dam, near Brits. Zinde was arrested soon afterwards and sent for psychiatric evaluation. He was initially released on R10000 bail, but it is claimed that he then assaulted his father, Dr Lebohang Manoto, at his Walkerville home, south of Joburg. His bail was revoked and he was sent for a second 
mental assessment following the alleged attack on his 
father.

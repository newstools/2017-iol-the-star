A former prostitute is expected to take the stand today and she and another former prostitute will testify in the trial of two Nigerian men, allegedly their pimps, as well as a woman accused of assisting the Nigerians. Brothers Obioma Benjamin Abba, 32, and Chinedu Justine Obasi, 38, along with South African citizen Nolwazi Patience Mkhonto, pleaded not guilty to a string of charges. The main charges against the brothers relate to human trafficking, money laundering and running a brothel, as well as drug-related charges. Judge Ronel Tolmay told the accused that if they were convicted they could face life terms in prison. Mkhonto faces charges relating to claims that she subleased a Sunnyside flat to the brothers knowing it would be used to harbour victims of human trafficking. Metro Police raided the flat last year and arrested the accused. The court was told this block of flats was well known among police for its prostitution-related activities. The police also often received complaints from the community that drug operations were run from some of the flats in the block. One of the former prostitutes apparently said she moved to Sunnyside in December 2015. She met a Nigerian man there with whom she started a relationship. After some time he demanded that she earn money so she could contribute to the daily living expenses. She said she became involved in prostitution because of the pressure he had placed on her to earn an income.

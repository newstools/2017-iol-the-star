Johannesburg - A "racist" advert by personal care and beauty company Dove on Sunday caused a storm on social media. The company came under fire when it posted a series of images during the week, supposedly aimed at "representing the beauty of diversity". In a sequence of images, a black woman is seen taking off a brown T-shirt, with a white woman being revealed in the last image. The images caused an uproar on social media, with users slamming the company and vowing to discontinue using its products. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa weighed in on the matter, saying he condemned the campaign and noted it was not the first time Dove was accused of racism.   We strongly condemn this racist campaign by @Dove & note with concern that this is not the first time they've been called out for racism. pic.twitter.com/28FEazUprx  â€” Min.

"Dove committed to representing the beauty of diversity. In an image we posted this week, we missed the mark in thoughtfully representing women of color and we deeply regret the offense that it has caused. "The feedback that has been shared is important to us and weâ€™ll use it to guide us in the future."   See more posts on the ad:   Thanks but no thanks. We're more than good as we are.

DJ Euphonik is showing local artists just how quick it can be to secure a good digital music distribution deal. The chart-topping DJ has partnered with Joox, a music streaming app, in partnership with TurnUp Music to release his latest summer hit, Ama Bhoza. Euphonik recently shared his views on sharing music easily on social media, tweeting that there was no point in holding on to great music, especially when people wanted to dance. He then met with the team from Joox and secured a deal. The song features DJ Tira, NaakMusiq and Bekzin Terris, and fans can stream it on the app. This isn't the first time the DJ has used social media to form a successful partnership. He recently teamed up with the makers of social media hit Tholukuthi Hey, Killer Kau and Mbali Sikwane, and got their hit played on several radio stations in a short space of time. He also got the young pupils into the studio to record the track officially. - Staff Reporter

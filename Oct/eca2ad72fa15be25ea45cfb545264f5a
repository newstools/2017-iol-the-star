Forecaster Victoria Nurse said yesterday there was nothing unusual about switching from extremely sunny days to rainy days during this time of the year. She added it was typical spring weather. “There is a combination of upper trough and surface trough; the upper trough is bringing in a mixture of tropical air into the system and we have a high pressure that is pushing low level moisture along our coast.” The rain around Joburg will be on and off. There is between 30% and 80% probability of showers today, 60% tomorrow. A cold front moved over the country on Wednesday, which resulted in windy, rainy and cold conditions in the Western and Northern Cape. Light snowfalls are also expected on the mountains bordering the Eastern Cape and Lesotho. Affected areas also include Free State and North-West, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. With this kind of weather, it will also be cooler over the country and will start warming up from Sunday. People need to be cautious of wet and slippery roads as occasional poor visibility and strong gusty winds would make for dangerous driving conditions.

Cape Town - Friends of a man who was shot and killed at Cubana in Stellenbosch along with mom of two Nicole Muller, says he is not a gangster but a family man. They say Donovan Jacobs, 40, from Delft was also enjoying a night out with friends when two suspects chased another man into the packed club in the early hours of Saturday morning. According to witnesses, the man ran into a toilet, and the two men who followed him fired shots into a group of people who were “in their way”. Muller, 30, who was out partying with friends, was shot in the head and died at the scene. A friend of Jacobs, who did not wish to be named, says contrary to news reports, Jacobs was not the man being chased. He was also standing near the toilet when the shots were fired and was hit by a bullet. Another woman was also injured. The friend says the father of three was a reformed convict who was out on parole. He did not want to say what Jacobs was convicted for.

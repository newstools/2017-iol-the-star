Last week, The Star reported that a seven-year-old boy took the gun to school allegedly to shoot a “bully” he claimed had been tormenting him. The police confiscated the firearm and launched a search for the owner, which  turned out to be the boy’s father. The man fled home when police arrived to question him. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubele said the whereabouts of the father was still unknown and that the authorities were looking for him. Makhubele said their firearm records showed that the gun was licensed and belonged to the man on the run. “We don’t know where he is presently, but according to our records it is the father’s gun. The gun registration records also show that he owns the gun and that he has a licence for it.” Makhubele said the police didn’t know why the man fled, but they were determined to find out as soon as they locate him. “When we get him, he is the one who can tell us why he ran away. We can’t speculate and we don’t know why he was not in the house. “But when we find him, he will have to answer to a charge of negligence relating to the firearm,” he said. The father may fear that he had contravened the regulations for the safe-keeping of a firearm, which stipulate that a gun should be kept locked in a safe. The SAPS Firearms Control Act states that “a firearm should be securely attached to a non-portable structure on which, or in which it is displayed by a metal attachment, chain, metal cable or similar device, in such a manner that the firearm cannot readily be removed, is not displayed and is not readily accessible to ammunition that can be discharged from it.” @Zwane_2li2ls

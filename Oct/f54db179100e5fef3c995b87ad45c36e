Yesterday, Add Hope and local volunteers and celebrities were invited to spend a few hours with children aged 4 to 6 at the Mould Empower Serve (MES) Dinaledi Preschool and Crèche, to experience how hope can make a difference in Hillbrow. October is World Hunger Month, and nutritious meals are the focus as part of making sure children are physically, mentally and emotionally prepared to live their best life with full tummies. MES helps boost children’s development daily through activities including chess, music, soccer and the arts. Thabisa Mkhwanazi, corporate affairs director for KFC in Africa, said: “What we do at KFC Add Hope is remind people of the need and real statistics around what hunger looks like in South Africa, and how they can make a difference. “Add Hope started in 2009 as a crazy idea from a South African perspective - we were looking at how we could do things differently. In creating ubuntu in the customer service industry, how can we co-create with our customers and use our footprint and the number of stores we have to unlock a change in communities? “We now have 137 beneficiaries across the country. Some are big national beneficiaries like JAM and some are local one-site beneficiaries like a Mama Rosa or a crèche. “We have raised over R400 million between the customer contributions and what KFC adds on top of that. We currently feed 120 000 children every day through Add Hope,” Mkhwanazi said. Add Hope ambassador and local television actor Sthembiso Khoza told The Star being the father of two daughters, this initiative was close to his heart. “It’s something where we as people in the industry get a moment to sort of give back.” @Zwane_2li2ls

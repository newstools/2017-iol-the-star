The 76-year-old Pretoria businessman was kidnapped on August 3 after leaving his company, Home Hyper City, in Pretoria. Carrim’s car was found abandoned near Erasmia, the next morning. “It has been 81 days since Omar has been missing. His abandoned vehicle was found in Laudium. One of the reasons I have launched this campaign is because I know Omar personally. He was very active in the community and his health is not good, as he suffers from a heart condition.” Abramjee also said it was inhumane for his kidnappers, whom he suspects are a syndicate operating at an international level, to hold a elderly sickly man for three months and pleaded for them to release Carrim unharmed. “Surely, there is someone who knows or has seen Omar? Please, if anyone knows anything come forward." The businessman's family refused to comment for fear of further endangering his life. Abramjee said syndicates targeting wealthy businessmen were sophisticated and highly trained individuals. “What is worrying is that these syndicates are becoming more daring and they are clearly sophisticated. "Kidnapping syndicates have been operating (in the country) for some time, taking their victims and demanding ransoms running into tens of millions of rand,” he said. Many of these gangs have been arrested. Others keep cropping up targeting largely Indian, Pakistani, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Zimbabwean and Mozambicans living in South Africa. “Many of the victims are forced to pay ransoms locally. Other gangs demand payment in foreign countries making it difficult for law-enforcement agencies to follow the trail,” Abramjee said. - Additional reporting by ANA

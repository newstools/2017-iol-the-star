Van Heerden, of the Western Cape, was the runner-up in this year’s Miss SA pageant, and yesterday, family and friends got a glimpse of her national costume and the gown she will be wearing at the event in China. Her traditional costume was designed by Matome Seshoka of Antherline Designs, while her finale gown was designed by Roxanne Pengilly. Seshoka said the design was inspired by the Ndebele people and that she wanted to showcase their extraordinary culture and authenticity. “They are the most colourful tribe and truly South African. “We fused this with a bit of Zulu culture to give the national costume a modern and young feel. The colours of our national flag give it a proudly South African look. We included a cape, which represents power and strength and is usually worn by Zulu queens.” Danielle Margaux is making the official Miss World designer competition outfit. “Both Adè and I are from the Western Cape. We are taking inspiration from the movement of the waves, the creatures and plants of the ocean.” Van Heerden will be representing South Africa against 123 other countries. The 26-year-old said she was delighted to be representing her home province and her country on November 18.

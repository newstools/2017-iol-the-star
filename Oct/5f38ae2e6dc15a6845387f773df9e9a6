He had to go through months of intense physical therapy to regain the ability to walk after he was hit by the debris from the collapsed bridge. The accident happened six days before his birthday. To celebrate his birthday this year, he wants to forget all about the accident for a few hours. “To celebrate this year, I am going to the Migos concert to forget about the accident. I just want to have fun,” he said. Carlinsky, who lives in Auckland Park, went back to work a few months after being discharged from hospital but his body is still healing from the trauma he suffered when he was trapped in the front seat of the taxi. As he could not cope with his workload any more, Carlinsky now works only four hours a day instead of eight. “I wanted to resign but I just had to endure. I need to work.” Now, he doesn’t use taxis anymore and instead relies on his family members to drive him to work or uses a bus. On his health, Carlinsky contracted pneumonia and a throat infection when he got out of the induced coma, said he was feeling better physically. “I do have a lot of problems when the weather gets cold. Even a simple thing like flu affects me badly. Three weeks ago, I had bronchitis from the pneumonia.”

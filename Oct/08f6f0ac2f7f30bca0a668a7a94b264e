Figures released by Police Minister Fikile Mbalula yesterday as part of the annual 2016/17 crime stats revealed that 4101 murders, 7700 rapes and 8731 house robberies were committed in the province. All three of these violent crimes increased from the previous year, with murders going up 6.7%, rapes up 1.2% and house robberies increasing by 10.6%. While Gauteng led the 19016 murders committed in the country, KwaZulu-Natal had 4014, the Eastern Cape 3628, Western Cape 3311, Mpumalanga 954, Free State 950, North West 901, Limpopo 813 and Northern Cape 344. A gloomy picture of Gauteng was also painted when it led the country’s 39828 reported rape cases and 22343 house robberies. In total, 503224 crimes were reported in the province over the reporting period - resulting in a shocking 3524 Gauteng residents per 100000 being victims of crime. What makes these figures even more scary is that these are just the reported crimes, while there is strong evidence that much of the criminal activity does not make it into the record books. Vuyo Mhaga, spokesperson for the Police Ministry, said Mbalula was concerned about the level of violent crimes in the province, saying alcohol and drug abuse played a big role. Mhaga added that the lack of social skills also contributed to the anomalous violence, as “someone can be provoked but will react to an extent where someone’s life can be lost”. He said the Police Ministry was working with other ministries, such as Health and Social Development, to adopt a holistic approach to curbing substance abuse and improving social skills. Another astonishing rise in violent crimes was in hijackings, which have shot up by 16.9% - from last year’s 7367 to the current figure of 8610 - while theft out of vehicles - “smash-and-grabs” - increased by 7.5% to 45266. This represents an occurrence of 124 smash-and-grabs reported daily in the province. At least 27674, or 76 vehicles and motorcycles a day, were reported stolen in Gauteng, representing a rise of 3.9% from last year. But not all the figures were depressing, as crimes detected as a result of police action increased by 3.9%, showing that police operations helped curb these shocking statistics somewhat. These crimes included illegal possession of firearms and ammunition; drug-related crimes; driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs; and sexual offences. In total, these crimes stood at 95403. Countrywide, crimes detected through police action increased by 9.6%. But this did not satisfy the police minister, who launched into a tirade about “lazy police efforts” in fighting crime. “This increase is too small and indicative of the lazy efforts by the police to detect such crimes in order to make South Africa a safer place to live in. Police in this instance are letting our people down and I am here to stop it,” Mbalula charged. “Gauteng, the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape must have increased police action. “When there is an increase in these sets of numbers (police action), it indicates more police work having taken place We continue to do less here We need to stop inertia and innovate.” Gareth Newham, head of justice and violence prevention at the Institute for Security Studies, expressed concern over the increase in murders and robberies, which he blamed on the police and governance. “It shows police are not getting a grip on serious violent crime, despite a budget increased by almost 50% since 2011/12 to R87billion. This is largely due to inappropriate political interference in the police. “The National Development Plan called it a ‘crisis of top management’ in the SAPS. President Jacob Zuma’s presidency has resulted in a profound deterioration in policing and caused a notable decline in public safety,” said Newham.

Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said Koko did not enter into any plea yesterday. He said the proceedings were just to allow the parties to agree on the procedures to be followed in conducting the hearings and the list of witnesses to testify. Phasiwe said the disciplinary hearing was related to the alleged awarding of contracts worth more than R1 billion to Impulse International while Koko’s stepdaughter was one of the company’s directors. He denied that Koko was given preferential treatment to “handpick” the officials to preside over the disciplinary case against him. Phasiwe said he had confirmed with the power utility’s human resources department that the reports were untrue. The chairperson of the disciplinary hearing was chosen independently by Eskom, while Koko was given the choice of three senior counsels to defend him in his disciplinary hearing, Phasiwe said. Phasiwe said allegations that Koko played a key role in awarding a R1.6 billion contract to global consultancy McKinsey and the Gupta-linked Trillian did not form part of the disciplinary hearings against him. “Those issues were part of another investigation. He is facing the disciplinary hearing for the allegations that he awarded contracts to a company in which his daughter was one of the directors,” he said. The Sunday Times and Business Day yesterday reported that they had seen correspondence in which Koko, through his lawyer Asger Gani, was given an “opportunity to elect one name from a list of senior counsels” to be approached to chair the disciplinary hearing against him. Koko reportedly rejected all three names, according to the Sunday Times, “because they are white men”. Eskom then presented another list. Koko reportedly chose Hamilton Maenetje, who was not available. Eskom then chose Sebetja Matsaung to preside over the case.

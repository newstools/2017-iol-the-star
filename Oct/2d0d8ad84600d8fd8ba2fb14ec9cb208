Cape Town -  Two people were shot and wounded outside the departures terminal at Cape Town International Airport early on Wednesday morning, police spokesman Vish Naidoo said. “There was a shooting at the drop and go section outside departures at 5.15am,” Naidoo told ANA. “A man was wounded and taken to hospital. We cannot release his identity. We are trying to locate his family.” Naidoo said a bystander was hit by a bullet and wounded and also rushed to hospital for treatment. There were unconfirmed reports that the shooting was gang-related. Police would not immediately comment on speculation that gunmen had targeted suspected leader of Cape Town’s Sexy Boys gang, Jerome “Donkie” Booysen. Naidoo said the police could not reveal where the victim was being treated as it could put his life in danger. “We cannot say that. There is a security risk.” Cape Town International Airport said the shooting did not affect its operations. According to police, the “drop and go” section was closed off and travellers were accommodated elsewhere. Roads to the airport remained open. * This is a developing story African News Agency

The new bottling of the fragrance will feature DJ Black Coffee on the can and inspire men across South Africa to find their magic. The limited edition is a celebration of the continued partnership with the two brands. In conjunction with the launch, AXE and DJ Black Coffee will give one lucky winner the chance to win their very own one-of-a-kind AXE house party, headlined by DJ Black Coffee himself and featuring some of today’s top South African music talent. The AXE house party will bring the energy and talent of the DJ to the winner and his friends so they can witness his magic live. “For years I’ve been fortunate to reach so many people through my music,” said DJ Black Coffee. “I’m excited to continue this journey with AXE in the hope of inspiring men to break out of the stereotypes that society defines for them and live their lives authentically.” Added Ryan Fauconier, who is the brand manager of AXE South Africa:
“We wanted our fans to join in the celebration of this partnership, which is why we have launched the limited edition deodorant. “We’ve come back from Ibiza where Kutloano Nhlapo showcased his magic alongside Black Coffee and now, with the AXE House Party, we wanted to bring Black Coffee’s magic back home,” said Fauconier.

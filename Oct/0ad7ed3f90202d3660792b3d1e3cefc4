Johannesburg - Again, we witnessed a dull, goalless Soweto derby. No surprises there. I get a sense the loyalty given to Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates by their supporters, is the same as that given to the ANC. They don’t deserve anyone’s support with such disappointing results when it matters the most. There is a lot of similarity among these three brands. They lack leadership transformation, they are resistant to change, and they are becoming irrelevant. The most common and disturbing denominator is the blind loyalty from their supporters. Ntate Khoza and Ntate Motaung started from the ground to make Pirates and Chiefs what they are today. Just like the ANC, the inability to transfer wisdom, pass on experience and groom good successors, is going to kill them. The late Dr Myles Munroe said: “Leadership success is measured by the success of your successor.” The Soweto giants will soon be former two great footballing clubs. The successors are not making any success of the great legacy - there was no great leadership foundation for them. They give us football fanatics, poor performances at every derby. They know they have loyal fans. Just like in the ANC, the days of Chiefs and Pirates enjoying huge support, are numbered. Such poor leadership skills is why I think these three big South African brands and their supporters belong to the same WhatsApp Group. * Kabelo Chabalala is the founder of the Young Men Movement.

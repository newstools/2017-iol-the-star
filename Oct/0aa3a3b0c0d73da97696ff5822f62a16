Miss South Africa 2017 Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters might be handing over the crown in the next few months, but her legacy will now officially last forever. ​S​he recently launched her own range of denim jeans in collaboration with international fashion brand Soviet.The opportunity to co-design a denim range under the Soviet label was part of the prize package for winning the coveted title. During the launch at the Soviet store at Mall of Africa in Midrand, the beauty queen said she was excited about the project. “How many 22-​year​-​olds can say they have got their own denim range? I am so blessed and grateful for this opportunity.” Nel-Peters added that she was a typical denim, T-shirt and sneakers kind of girl. 
Soviet Denim Managing Director Caroline Hardman said Nel-Peters was the perfect fit for the fashion label.
“Demi is obviously quite close to our heart. She was a model for our brand two years ago and we were extremely excited when she was appointed as Miss South Africa​.”  Last night was unreal! @sovietdenim you are a dream team. Thank you for such a beautiful launch especially to @ljhpr @michels_mou amd @daneventer92 for putting it all together! I have my first Denim range! How crazy! 🙈😬🤗 #DemiDenim #sovietdenim #demileighnelpeters #dlnp #misssouthafrica2017 A post shared by Miss South Africa 2017 (@demileighnp) on Oct 5, 2017 at 10:50pm PDT  Hardman explained that they decided to launch an exclusive denim edition range for ladies which is aptly named after the current Miss SA title holder.
“It's done through her particular tastes and preferences. We designed the jeans around a briefing from her,” said Hardman.
The first pair of jeans which is part of Nel-Peters collection is called ‘Artemis’​.​
“Every girl needs a classic, dark denim in her closet,” said Hardman, "We chose this style because we knew that Demi would need a denim that she could dress up-for that important meet and greet or down- when having Sunday lunch with family.”
Both Hardman and Nel-peters said the second denim, called ‘Presephone’, was the more popular pair.
“This denim boasts a heavy rip and repair style which is on trend in the fashion world,”  said Hardman. It also features extra detail which Nel-Peters requested;​ a rose gold Protea flower, the ripped denim trend and glitter. Liesl Laurie was the first Miss South Africa to co-brand her denim jeans in 2015, followed by Ntandoyenkosi Kunene in 2016, during her reign. These products are available to Soviet Denim customers and Miss South Africa supporters within their sixteen stores nationwide.  @Zwane_2li2ls

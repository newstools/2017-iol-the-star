Durban - A video – showing a female police officer styling another’s hair at a KwaZulu-Natal police station– has garnered disapproval from police minister Fikile Mbalula. The video was shared on Twitter by Thully Nkosi, who is based in the northern KwaZulu-Natal town of Newcastle. She also tagged the minister. The post said: “Minister, this is what is happening at Madadeni SAPS when I went to request for police assistance.” The tweet was accompanied by this video, spanning 45 seconds:  Nkosi received backlash for her post from other social media users, who said she was looking for attention and to "get famous". She responded that she had been trying to seek help for an elderly woman who had been the victim of domestic violence. Mbalula said via his Twitter account that he has “activated action” in relation to the police officers.  Thanks for alerting me, we have activated action.

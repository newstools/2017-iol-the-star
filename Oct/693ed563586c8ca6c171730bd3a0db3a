This is as some of the cast from US show The Bold and the Beautiful will make a special guest appearance in the local programme Isidingo. This convergence is as South Africa celebrates 30 years of the long-running soapie being aired in the country. The three-decade run has meant different generations of people being glued to their screen to watch the lives of those from the The Bold unfold over the years. It is still unclear who exactly from The Bold and the Beautiful will make an appearance on SABC3â€™s Isidingo, but it has been announced that a storyline has been written by the Isidingo writing team to include the US actors. They will be on set on October 24 for the shoot. Meanwhile, The Bold and the Beautiful publicity tour will also take place in South Africa. This will see Jacob Young, who plays Rick Forrester; Heather Tom, who stars as Katie Logan; and Karla Mosley, who acts as Maya Avant Forrester, visiting Joburg from this Saturday to next Tuesday. They will then proceed to Cape Town from October 25 to October 26. During this time, it is believed that these stars will make guest appearances on Isidingo. It has also been reported that during their time in the country, the US stars will be visiting iconic South African landmarks such as Table Mountain, Soweto and a range of cultural, heritage and entertainment sites. According to online entertainment site Channel 24, their visit will include them hosting "mall activations" within Mall of Africa in Midrand and Maponya Mall in Soweto. The site also reported that a private event hosted by the stars would include an interactive karaoke session alongside prominent South African celebrities as well as a "meet and greet" with competition winners of the show.

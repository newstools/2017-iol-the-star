Nicole Muller, 30, was one of two people shot and killed at the Cubana nightclub in Stellenbosch shortly after midnight on Saturday morning. According to an eyewitness, two gunmen had fired shots into a crowd of people after the man they were hunting had initially evaded them. Phaks Photh’inja, who was at the club during the shooting, said that two men ran into the club chasing another man. “They shot at him so he ran into the bathroom and they followed him but the crowd was in the way so they fired three or four shots directly into the crowd,” he told Weekend Argus. He says Nicole was shot in the head and that he went over to help her. “She was lying on the dance floor bleeding and I went to go help her but she seemed to be unconscious. I don’t think she had anything to do with the guys that were shooting,” says Phaks. On Sunday Nicole’s heartbroken sister Sherri Alfestus, 32, said the family was devastated. “My sister lived in Kuils River, was married and had two sons, aged 4 and 5. The family is distraught,” she said. “She was out with friends when she was at the club.” She said the family met  on Sunday to discuss what had happened and find a way 
forward for Nicole’s husband and children. Cops have opened an investigation of double murder and attempted murder following the attack. Captain FC van Wyk said on Sunday that no arrests have been made yet. The other person killed was a 40-year-old man, the person the two shooters were chasing.

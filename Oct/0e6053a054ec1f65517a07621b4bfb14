Police spokesperson Captain Matthews Nkoadi said a search was under way for Mashigo. However, Nkoadi said she was suspected to be with her boyfriend. “Puseletso Mashigo went missing over a week ago, apparently with her boyfriend. Her phone rings forever unanswered and eventually goes on voicemail,” he told The Star. She was last seen in Jansen Street, Orchards, in Pretoria at about 7am on the day of her disappearance. Mashigo was wearing a white shirt, grey pants and black shoes at the time. She has scars on her thigh and right side of her chin. Her family reported her missing to Pretoria North police station. She describes herself on her social media profiles as “outgoing and bubbly”. Despite her being reported missing, and the Pink Ladies missing-children organisation posting messages regarding her disappearance - and the police conducting a frantic search for her - Mashigo has been active on social media. Her last post on Facebook was on September 29. She wrote: “Some things are just impossible to tolerate.” Other recent posts are “it’s been way too long” and “If they act like they don’t care about you, believe them.” She has not only been present on social media, but has been replying to comments as well. Pink Ladies director Dessie Rechner said the organisation dealt with too many cases of missing persons and were unable to focus on the circumstances surrounding Mashigo’s disappearance.

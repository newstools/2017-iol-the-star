Johannesburg - The three men allegedly involved in the murder of Rhythm City star, Dumi Masilela, made a brief appearance at the Benoni Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday morning. This follows the trio’s previously appearance on September 8, where the court heard that fingerprints successfully linked one of the two men arrested in connection with the attempted hijacking, to the incident. The court postponed the matter to November 28 for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to decide on what charges will be kept and whether further court proceedings will be heard in Benoni or at the High Court in Joburg. Mfundo Nkosi, Bongani Masumbuka and Solly Mukhuba, face charges of murder, hijacking, attempted hijacking and the possession of an unlicensed firearm. All three men remain in custody. Masilela died in hospital on August 3, after he was shot in an attempted hijacking in Tembisa. Gauteng police said that Masilela and a friend sped off after they were approached by attackers in a Jeep in Tembisa on August 2. The men responded by firing shots at them. Masilela later died in hospital. Earlier this month a tribute to the slain actor, Masilela, Rhythm City recently took a decision to incorporate his death into the exit storyline of his character, Sifiso Ngema. Producer Yula Quinn said the show decided to put together an episode which would be a celebration of both the actor and the character. Masilela's character appeared for the last time on the soapie on October 11. @Zwane_2li2ls  nokuthula.zwane@inl.co.za  The Star

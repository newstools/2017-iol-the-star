She and her husband ran out to assist the shaken victim who shouted for help. “His hand was bleeding and his thumb was swelling very quickly. He said he could not move it. I called the police and also gave the man some sugar water to calm him down. He was in shock. He says the guys ran up to him and he had gotten such a fright he slipped and fell,” she says. “His cellphone had then fallen out as one man held a gun to his head. This he swears is the only reason he is alive.” She says it looked like one of the thugs was a taxi guard as he still had a money bag in his hand. “These taxis are not supposed to drive in the residential areas. Our area is a target lately and people need to be vigilant and take care,” says Rafiqa. Police spokesperson, Sinathi Joni, confirms a case of armed robbery was reported and no arrests were made.

The Braamfontein venue filled up on Saturday night to see the musician, whose work spans three decades. The theme for the night was "A Destination Unknown”. In a recent interview he described the meaning behind the theme. “It tells a story of how unpredictable music is. It also highlights the importance of teamwork; rehearsing with a band and shaping the music in a certain direction; the spirit of the moment and how the audience drives it.” Music lovers were treated to an awe-inspiring live performance and jam session led by Faku, who was joined by Bokani Dyer on piano, Shane Cooper on bass, Kesivan Naidoo on drums and Keenan Ahrends on guitar. Faku was born in New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, and has worked with great artists such as the late Victor Ntoni and Zim Ngqawana, Abdullah Ibrahim and Oliver Mtukudzi, among others. He has toured the world performing in Switzerland, the US, Norway and the Netherlands. Some of his best work can be found on his albums Hommage, The Colours They Bring, Hope and Honour and Le Ngoma. “My music doesn’t belong to me. It is music for the people. Playing for people is always a great experience “You give and they receive with gratitude,” he pointed out. - Staff Reporter

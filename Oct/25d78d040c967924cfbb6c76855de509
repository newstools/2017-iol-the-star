Johannesburg - Avian influenza has hit Johannesburg with 598 carcasses of birds having been recovered from the City of Joburg facilities at Westdene Dam, Emmarentia Dam, Zoo Lake and and Joburg Zoo. Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo (JCPZ) has confirmed that some of its facilities have been affected by the outbreak that was first detected in Limpopo and which has been spread by the seasonal migration of birds. JCPZ spokesperson Jenny Moodley said that from September 1 to date, the facility has recovered over 548 carcasses and “most have tested positive for the strain of Avian Influenza that is not contagious to humans.” All the dead birds are being incinerated and are being handled as per strict health and safety regulations, she said. The Joburg Zoo has also posted signs alerting visitors of the outbreak to ensure that they stick to the footpaths at the entrances and exits, and report all instances of  birds they identify as being sick. These can be identified if the birds look lethargic or have ruffled feathers. “We are concerned about our birds, especially the valuable and endangered species but we are vaccinating as much as possible. Many of our bird species are safe as they are under cover, but we are monitoring the free-roaming ones,” she added. Avian influenza is not contagious to humans so there is no need for concern, she said. The zoo has a team on standby to recover dead carcasses.

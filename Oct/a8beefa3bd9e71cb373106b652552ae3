Matati, 23, went missing last year after attending a party with a friend in the south of Joburg. She left the party with alleged cash-in-transit kingpin Thabo Happy Mosia. Her friend got  a lift home with someone else. Lenasia police spokesperson Captain Mpande Khoza confirmed that a second suspect had been arrested over Matati’s disappearance and murder. Khoza said Julian Ntoyi made his first appearance in the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court yesterday. He was remanded until Monday. Mosia was arrested five months after Matati went missing. Last week, her mother Gloria Sibuye said she believes Mosia killed her daughter when she refused to give him information about the movements of cash-in-transit vehicles. Matati worked at SBV Services. Last week, Sibuye identified her daughter’s body at the state mortuary in Bronkhorstspruit. Her body was found half-naked in Bronkhorstspruit last year and was kept at the mortuary.

Despite the best efforts along the river of various residents associations, estate gardening teams and even volunteers from Keith Kirsten Nursery, the river continues to be heavily polluted, not least with plastic waste. Year after year, as the rains arrive, the pollution from Alexandra, Bruma and other suburbs continues to pour down the river. It is an absolute disgrace that the City of Joburg has made no effort to provide adequate facilities for the residents of Alex so that the pollution levels of the Jukskei can at least be curtailed. And, of course, the policing of illegal disposal into the river should be done. Mr Mayor (Herman Mashaba), I invite you to come along and maybe bring your family for a picnic lunch by the river to see for yourself. Joburg Water replies: We have cleared two blockages, one from Mayibuye Park, where there was a broken pipe. This was not a big spill, but we have repaired it. The other blockage was in Klipfontein View which has been resolved. We have a spill in the Midrand Industrial Estate and Paving Warehouse and have requested permission for under-road drilling which is taking long to finalise. In Midrand, there is pollution coming from Klipfontein View and the Mayibuye areas. There are continuous blockages which pollute the stream through Glen Austin, which then flows into the Jukskei River. All residents of the City of Joburg, and especially those that are living close to the Jukskei River, are urged to come every last weekend of the month on the city cleaning campaign, A Re Sebetseng, which was initiated and led by Mashaba.

Johannesburg - The anti-state capture march to consultancy firm McKinsey & Company SA in Joburg was not dampened by the rain as scores of people showed up to register their displeasure with corruption on Thursday. Civil society organisations under the banner of Future SA went to McKinsey following numerous reports that the global firm allegedly had a key hand in "extorting" roughly R1.6 billion from power utility Eskom. This, the organisations believe, has weakened state-owned entities in favour of the Gupta family. Popo Molefe, former chairperson of the SOE the Passenger Rail Agency of SA, told The Star he joined the march to alert the public at how state entities "are key to advancing the country's economic transformation".   "If we allow them (SOEs) to be captured, what future will this country have?" Molefe asked. His views were echoed by Neeshan Balton, convenor of Future SA and the director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, who said Future SA would remain will not be apolitical, but would remain non-partisan.    "However, we will be scrutinising all political party candidates ahead of the 2019 general elections to ensure that candidates implicated in project state capture are exposed to the public," Bolton asserted.    @khayakoko88  khaya.koko@inl.co.za  The Star

Johannesburg - Life Esidimeni arbitrator former Justice Dikgang Moseneke has said the hearing will not conclude until former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu appears. Mahlangu, who was in charge when the mental health marathon project was put in place, was not placed on the witness list for the alternative dispute resolution. Psychiatry patients were moved from Life Esidimeni to several NGOs as a cost saving measures. This resulted in over a 100 of them dying of hunger, neglect and dehydration. On Monday, Solidarity announced they had Moseneke’s permission to subpoena Mahlangu, who is studying in the United Kingdom. On Tuesday morning, the hearing heard that Mahlangu is writing examinations and will inform the arbitration when she can appear before it. The hearings are supposed to conclude on Friday but Moseneke said this will not happen until Mahlangu appears. “Nobody will be exonerated. The State must ensure that their former employees are here. We will not end the hearings until she appears,” Moseneke said. Mahlangu has indicated that she will voluntarily testify at the hearing after concluding her exams. Other government officials expected to appear before Moseneke include Gauteng premier David Makhura and national Heath Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi. The Star

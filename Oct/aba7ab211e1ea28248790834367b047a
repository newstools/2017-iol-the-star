Seven police stations were represented and named after various cultural groups. Brooklyn was Afrikaner, Garsfontein Coloured, Lyttelton Zulu, Silverton Xhosa, Pretoria Moot Sepedi, Villieria Sesotho, and the Flying Squad and K9 were Indian. The stations and the units were assigned various cultures and had to dress up in the traditional attires of their group. They also had to prepare traditional food and give performances during their exhibitions at the Maritimo Sports Club in Hatfield.  The event co-ordinator, Captain Colette Weilbach of the Brooklyn SAPS, said they wanted to bring together the cluster, demonstrate unity, and get to know each other on a social level in order to fight crime effectively. “This celebration was to create unity within the cluster, as we are embarking on a lot of crime prevention initiatives together. And if you know your colleague on a social level, we can form bonds and fight crime more effectively. “We also wanted to embrace our different cultures within the police force, to say that we serve all the people of South Africa and that everybody is welcome to come into our police stations and receive great service,” she said. Weilbach said it was their last celebration before the festive season gets under way, where the focus would switch to ensure everybody had a safe holiday period. Zola Nhanhana, an administration clerk for the Silverton SAPS, said the combination of different cultures gave them a chance to learn about their colleagues and their country. “It makes us a rainbow nation and it’s great to see all the cultures represented here. “It’s very nice that we are not only going after criminals, but also celebrating our heritage together as people who are working for the SAPS.” Semakaleng Tindeka, commanding officer at the Villieria SAPS, said: “I have a diverse station, with all the cultures represented; this is an excellent way to build a strong team.”

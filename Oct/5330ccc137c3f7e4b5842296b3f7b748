Kaye Ally, Johannesburg Pride chairperson and organiser, said: “It’s a very special day for us, we have managed to pull off yet another Pride. It’s my sixth Pride, there is a phenomenal crowd and social media is at a feverish pitch and we are so grateful for everyone who has come out in spite of the cold wind. “People need to come and take the parade seriously and we need to go out in the streets in numbers. “We need to create visibility and create a platform for people to reflect and understand that the need for Pride is still very relevant.” She added that the organisation was trying to balance and advocate against the atrocities done to the LBGTIQ+ community in recent years. “We need to acknowledge and celebrate our sexuality. If you look at Africa, there are vague LBGTIQ+ laws,” Ally added.  The build up to the Pride parade saw a performance from Karabo Mogane, former Idols winner and the event was hosted by the flamboyant Delta The Leo. Mogane told The Star that this was his first Pride parade. “It was really awesome performing in front of a lot of people and I see that it is well supported and it’s a great initiative. The platform is huge and I am really grateful to be a part of
 it.” Vice-president of Interpride Frank Van Dalen said there were more than 1000 Pride events taking place worldwide. This year, Joburg Pride introduced a fashion show to the event. Designer Nolene du Preez of NDP created several fabulous designs for the occasion. The parade started from the Pride Village in Melrose Boulevard and went across the inner precinct of Melrose Arch. Meanwhile, things could not have been more colourful when lesbian couple Simone and Allison got engaged during the parade.  Festivities ran well into the night as celebrities such as Nomzamo Mbatha, Cassper Nyovest and Pride local deejay, DJ Skye, set the mood. @Zwane_2li2ls

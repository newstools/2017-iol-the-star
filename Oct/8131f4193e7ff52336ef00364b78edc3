At a media briefing held in Joburg this week, the founding member of Skwatta Kamp said the album had taken his website SlikourOnLife to new heights. “The Incubator album takes SlikourOn Life to the next level. We have selected the best hip hop songs and compiled them into an album, and I’m taking everything I would do for myself and handing it over to these artists.” The album was launched on October 10. Metane provided the resources necessary for the young artists to help jump-start their careers. He has been in the music industry for a long time and is one of the founding members of the group that popularised South African hip hop. The up-and-coming talents will receive access to resources that include a music video for their songs, a press conference, streaming, a publicity campaign and a TV distribution channel. The artists come from various parts of the country and range between the ages of 19 and 27. “Whenever I hear great talent I always ask myself - what if these kids need that one chance that got me to where I am today? I live by the theory that we all have a CSI (corporate social investment) responsibility and I have the relationships and resources to bring media, industry and artists together. It’s my responsibility to utilise them.” Metane has entered into partnerships that will ensure the careers of the young talents are accelerated. “My vision is to create a voice for the youth in the culture and we’ve been able to achieve that with SlikourOnLife. I’m passing my insights, learning and knowledge to the next generation, that’s the heart of SlikourOnLife Incubator.”

Twenty-eight Grade 4 pupils from Mooifontein Primary School in the Ekurhuleni town have been placed on the HIV/Aids drugs after being pricked by syringes at school. One of their classmates brought a relative’s syringes from home and she and two friends started injecting their classmates with them. Dr Khutjo Mothapo, who works with HIV/Aids patients, said some of the side effects that the pupils will experiences include hallucinations, nightmares, vomiting, drowsiness and nausea. He said the symptoms would pass once the pupils had completed their medical care. Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona confirmed that the pupils had started experiencing the side effects. “Unfortunately, some learners reacted negatively to the medication by vomiting, while others experienced diarrhoea,” he said. A case of negligence has been opened against the pupil’s relative, and the syringes have been taken to a laboratory for tests. Mothapo said it was important for patients to dispose of their medical supplies in a safe manner. “Patients who take syringes home are given a bucket to dispose of the syringes. Once the bucket is 75% full, they can take it to an incinerator or the hospital so it can be safely disposed of. “Even if the syringes are unused, they also have to be placed out of the reach of children,” Mothapo said. Yesterday, the school declined to comment, but said all the learners were back at school. Mabona said the school governing body was taking disciplinary action.

Cricket SA (CSA) and Lorgat agreed to mutually “part ways”, despite the 57-year-old still having two years left on his contract. While CSA may incur heavy penalties amounting to millions of rand in lieu of a payout to Lorgat, The Star understands the board have accepted this, due to concerns over his handling of the GL T20 - especially the dealings relating to the broadcast agreement. “We recently tried on a few occasions to remedy the situation between Mr Lorgat and the board, but we have not been successful in finding a satisfactory resolution,” CSA president Chris Nenzani said in a statement. “The board unanimously felt it was in the best interests of the organisation that we agreed to a mutual separation agreement with Mr Lorgat.” Lorgat had apparently taken sole control of setting up the broadcast deal for that competition, in the process upsetting many of the CSA’s board members, who weren’t privy to details regarding any aspect of the negotiations. As of yesterday, with the tournament just over a month away, no TV deal had yet been signed, casting doubt over the tournament. Lorgat had stated in June that the GLT20 was a purely “commercial” initiative - with the CSA even choosing to eschew its stringent quota policy to attract foreign investment - and that he was looking for the highest monetary figure he could attain. At that stage, SuperSport were said to be the favourites to land the broadcast rights, but Lorgat and Ortus Sport & Entertainment, the company he hired to negotiate the TV deal, were unable to reach agreement with SuperSport. Ortus is owned by Venu Nair, a previous employee of international marketing group Lagardère, which the CSA  - through Lorgat - had hired to negotiate the deal. Nair left Lagardère in April, taking the CSA  rights with him. Lorgat was in India earlier this week, where he was understood to be meeting with executives over a broadcast deal, a clear indication that the negotiations with SuperSport had broken down.

Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said police were investigating the the death of Laurina Ryk, who lived on Vergenoegd Farm in De Doorns. “A murder case was registered for investigation regarding the murder of a 26-year-old woman on September 2 about 9.50pm at Vergenoegd Farm in Orchard, De Doorns. According to reports, the victim and suspect had an argument that ended up in a fight, and the suspect hit the victim with a spade over her head,” said Van Wyk. The victim died at the scene due to the severity of her injuries, and her boyfriend was arrested. A family member, who asked that his name be withheld, said the couple were enjoying their evening with friends at Ryk’s mother’s home on the farm when the two started arguing. “They were partying and 
drinking with friends, and he became like a man possessed, and no one could stop him. “He hit her several times with a shovel, and her brains were visible. He told another person that he would be next once he came out for Laurina’s murder in a year or two,” said the family member. He said the suspect carried Ryk’s body to his home nearby, leaving her on the porch until police arrived, at which point he handed himself 
over. The family member said the 
suspect and Ryk had a one-year-old child. He said the family were in severe shock, and while they had no qualms with how the police had dealt with the matter, they demanded justice. De Doorns Community Policing Forum spokesperson Jean Amsterdam confirmed that the matter had been reported to police, and that the suspect was in custody. Cape Times

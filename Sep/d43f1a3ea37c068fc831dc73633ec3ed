Johannesburg - Religious leader Prophet Paseka "Mboro" Motsoeneng's legal woes could be over as a Â police source in Alberton confirmed on Thursday that there aren't any cases against him in Gauteng. This contradicts statements made by Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, the chairperson of the CRL Rights Commission; a Chapter 9 institution of the Constitution. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva asserted in a July interview on SABC's Question Time that "two charges had been opened" for Mboro, where she intimated that his arrest was imminent. This relates to the CRL inquiries, which were held from 2015 and last year, to probe religious practices that are allegedly untoward. These include "prophets and pastors", who make congregants eat snakes and grass, and Mboro who sells "holy water". This, Mboro said, was the reason he went to the Alberton Detective Services to hand himself over, adding it was the detectives' "function to investigate matters that are reported to them". However, a source in Alberton said records showed there were no warrants of arrest for the Katlehong-based religious leader, saying Mkhwanazi-Xaluva should provide proof of the supposed pending arrest. "We can't just arrest someone without a case number. If we receive a case number, we will arrest him (Mboro)," the source, who asked to remain anonymous, said. @khayakoko88 Khaya.koko@inl.co.za

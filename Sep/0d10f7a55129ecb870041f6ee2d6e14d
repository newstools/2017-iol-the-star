The mining magnate will be featured in the 100th anniversary edition of the publication, which is due to be released later this month. Other prominent figures who made it into the collector’s edition of the magazine include the likes of the co-founder of the Microsoft Corporation, Bill Gates, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, media personality Oprah Winfrey, Virgin group founder Richard Branson and American investor Peter Lynch. Some celebrities such as Bono, P Diddy and Martha Stewart will also write an essay for the edition as part of 100 of the world’s “greatest business minds”. Motsepe has been described in the special edition as Africa’s first black billionaire and an entrepreneurial icon. In an essay, he details how he bought neglected mines and worked hard to refurbish them so that they would benefit those who work there. “We ran our businesses differently and it worked, we paid our workers based on profitability, with bonuses based on aspiration target that, if achieved, created money for the mineworkers, the company and the shareholders 
alike.” US business magnate, investor and philanthropist Warren Buffet graces the cover of the 100th edition of Forbes while holding a much older edition of the publication. Apart from the 100 business icons from around the world who write essays for the special edition, the magazine also features business-related stories which have made an impact on the modern world. Forbes executive chief Steve Forbes said: “What’s ahead? Here’s betting that in 2117, people will be infinitely richer with an unimaginably higher standard of living than that we are experiencing today. And Forbes, if guided by the spirit of its founder, will be there to celebrate it.”

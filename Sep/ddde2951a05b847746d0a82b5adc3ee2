Fast-forward to 2017 and the gin revolution is bigger than ever, with South Africa no exception. Local distillers are producing world-class gins using indigenous botanicals (think fynbos, buchu and even rooibos). These brands have placed South Africa firmly on the international gin map, and the world is taking notice. On Saturday, September 30, the inaugural SA Gin Festival will be hosted at the Riversands Farm Village in Fourways. The event will be a celebration of gin, with more than 15 local gin suppliers exhibiting. The event will give visitors an opportunity to sample a large variety of craft gins while learning more about the gin-making process from the distillers. The festival will also boast live music and a variety of food stalls. If you're interested in learning more about gin or simply want to enjoy a relaxing day out with friends or family, the SA Gin Festival is not to be missed. The festival is hosted by the SA Gin Society, in association with Schweppes. Tickets are available online from www.saginsociety.co.za The Star is giving away 10 double tickets to the SA Gin Festival.

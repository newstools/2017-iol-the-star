So said Flo Bird of the Johannesburg Heritage Foundation, who, together with members of the group, went to five neglected heritage buildings and placed black “heritage horror” plaques on their walls. Heritage sites are normally marked with blue plaques of a similar size. “We have been erecting these plaques because of our outrage. It seems the right time during Heritage Month to shame the owners,” Bird said. Among the targeted buildings are the old Queen Victoria Hospital, the Rissik Street post office, the Marshalltown barracks, the Superintendent’s House in Hillbrow and the Rand Water building in the CBD. The action group was formed amid growing concerns regarding the state of Gauteng’s heritage. Representatives from various heritage conservation bodies have joined. These include representatives from Alberton Heritage, the Cullinan Heritage Society, the Egoli Heritage Foundation, the Greater Alexandra Tourism and Heritage Association, the James Mpanza Legacy Foundation, the Johannesburg Heritage Foundation, the Old Pretoria East Residents’ and Ratepayers’ Alliance, the Modderfontein Conservation Society, Pretoria Institute of Architects, Sandton Heritage Association and Tshwane Building Heritage Association.

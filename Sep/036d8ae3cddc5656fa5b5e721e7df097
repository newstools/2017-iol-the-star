Johannesburg - Seven people were injured in a shootout outside a block of flats in the inner of the Joburg CDB on Wednesday afternoon. 
Gauteng South African Police Service spokesperson Kay Makhubele confirmed that around 12pm seven people were shot and injured, amongst them one female was injured. All victims were taken to the nearest hospital. 
Makhubele said: “A man came to the place where there were homeless people and he instructed them to move. They allegedly refused. The man went away and came back in a kombi with a group of people, who told them (the homeless people)  to move, that was when the friction started.” 
“They started throwing stones and shooting occurred. A case of attempted murder has been opened” he said.
No arrest has been made and the suspect is unknown. 
ER24 paramedics were called onto the scene shortly after 12h15 and found local authorities already in attendance, this according to ER24 paramedics spokesperson Russel Meiring.
“Allegedly there had been an altercation about relocation and the shootout occurred” said Meiring. 
“Upon closer inspection, paramedics found a woman and six men lying outside the block of flats. Paramedics immediately assessed the patients and found that two were in a critical condition while the five others had sustained injuries ranging from minor to serious” said Meiring in a statement. 
Paramedics immediately treated the patients and provided the critically and seriously injured with advanced life support interventions.

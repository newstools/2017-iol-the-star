The City of Joburg is challenging residents to commit the fourth Saturday of every month to cleaning the streets of all communities. Member of the mayoral committee for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba appealed to all residents, even those in “little corners”, to participate. “Although the responsibility of cleaning and disposing of waste is the mandate of Pikitup, it is impossible for the entity, with a staff complement of more than 4000 employees, to ensure that the 1645 square kilometres of Joburg, which has 135 wards, is kept spotlessly clean,” she said. Illegal dumping and littering cost the city millions of rand - money that could be used to fund employment-creating projects as opposed to wasting money on avoidable expenses, she added. The city’s new A Re Sebetseng programme is modelled along a similar initiative in Rwanda’s capital, Kigali, which was honoured by the UN in 2008 for its cleanliness levels. The City of Joburg recently sent a delegation there to garner lessons on public participation in cleanliness. On the last Saturday of the month, everyone in Rwanda sets aside their personal engagements to carry out a communal cleaning service. No one between the ages of 18 and 65 is spared, and through such massive monthly clean-up campaigns, Rwanda was able to achieve its spectacular cleanliness levels and also sustain these levels, said Sifumba. Bags can be picked up today from the nearest Pikitup depot, city libraries, clinics or walk-in centres. Residents can call 087-357-1126 or e-mail aresebetseng@pikitup.co.za to arrange for full waste bags to be collected. Residents can report illegal dumping on 0860-562-874/ 011-375-5555 or at info@pikitup.co.za

The 134 heritage totem poles, which have been erected in the new council chamber, were a highlight of the awards. The totems reflect the stories of the residents of the city. JPC spokesperson Bliss Yeni said: “Over the centuries, one of the most important ways culture has been celebrated and transferred, is through the visual arts. And the new council chamber totems which are now in full view of the public and the councillors, do just that on a daily basis.” . A competition was launched for the design of the totems. “Participants who won were just overjoyed and could not believe their artwork would be displayed in those hallowed corridors. Their pride was overwhelming to community leaders and humbling. “Joburg has been a cosmopolitan city from the outset - a burgeoning community built on diversity. “From the San people who originally inhabited the region, to the groups of Bantu-speaking people who started moving southwards from Central Africa by the 13th century, to people who flocked here from far and wide in the Gold Rush of the late 1800s, Joburg, Jozi, eGoli, Plek van Goud, is no stranger to multiplicity and the uniqueness it brings. “With this colourful palette of history and culture as a backdrop, participants in the art competition were able to draw on and express their personal Jozi experiences, perspectives and heritage,” she said. The winners of the artworks were each awarded R5000. @annacox

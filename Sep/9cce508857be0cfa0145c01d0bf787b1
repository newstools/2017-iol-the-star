During the conclusion of the pre-sentencing proceedings, prosecutor Pratisha Salie said there were no substantial circumstances to make the court deviate from handing down the minimum sentence of 10 years. The Sweety My Baby hitmaker was found guilty in July of the rape at his Ruimsig home in 2013. “She tried to look up to him as her father and he should’ve seen this,” Salie said. The prosecutor added that Brickz was a celebrity and would most likely be able to continue with his life after serving his sentence. Salie said rape was a serious matter and the court had to take into account that the victim was young and was not coping well after the incident. “She had locked herself in a cupboard and at some point she was found with many pills in her possession and was suicidal,” the prosecutor said. “She couldn’t come to terms with the ordeal, indicated that she was robbed of what she considered her ‘prize possession', something that could never be replaced.” The teenager had lost her mother and her father when she was taken in by her uncle, Brickz. He then violated her. Salie said she disagreed with the defence’s report which depicted Brickz as a humble person who people looked up to and an asset to society. The prosecutor reminded the court that a doctor testified that the accused did not use a condom, and as a result, the victim had contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Salie said the court had to consider the circumstantial evidence provided and that Brickz had not shown remorse. Earlier, defence attorney Piet du Plessis implored the court to be lenient, saying his client was a first offender who could be rehabilitated. Brickz is due to be sentenced on October 17. - ANA

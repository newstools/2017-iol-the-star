Thirty-year-old Happy Jele was arrested and taken to Sandton police station after he was caught allegedly driving at 223km/* . He was charged with reckless driving and exceeding the prescribed limit of 120km/* . Jele’s agent, Jazzman Mahlakgane, told The Star that Jele was at home and preparing an apology to the club and fans. According to Orlando Pirates spokesperson Floyd Mbele, the club had not released any formal response on the matter. Driving a BMW 135i on the M1 near Sandton, Jele was caught by metro police for doing an average speed of 223km/*  in a 120km/*  zone. According to a statement released by Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, Jele was arrested in the early hours of yesterday. Nkosi-Malobane expressed disappointment and condemned the footballer. “I am disappointed at Happy Jele’s driving behaviour and conduct. Professional players are supposed to be role models and safety ambassadors. The law enforcement agencies will not tolerate lawless behaviour on Gauteng roads, especially with the high rate of fatalities reported in the province,” said Nkosi-Malobane. The department appealed to motorists to drive with caution and abide by the rules of the road at all times. Joburg metro police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar confirmed to The Star that several other motorists were arrested for going over the limit. They were expected to appear in court soon. @Zwane_2li2ls

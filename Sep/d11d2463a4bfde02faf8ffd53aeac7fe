Cape Town - EFF leader Julius Malema is set to graduate with a BA Honours Degree in Philosophy with Unisa on Wednesday, his party announced on Tuesday. "We are proud of this achievement as it impresses upon all to value education," EFF spokesman Mbuyseni Ndlozi said on Tuesday. "With all the pressures of serving our people in the EFF, Parliament and Africa, the CIC Julius Malema still made time to improve his education. We say this with the full knowledge that fees remain the biggest stumbling block for many to access education. To that end, the qualifications of the CIC must be proof that those who demand the end to fees in universities do so because they are indeed academically deserving," Ndlozi said. Early on in his political career, the former ANC Youth League president’s matric results came under the spotlight when an emailed list did the rounds showing that he had only achieved an H in maths and a G in woodwork, both on the Standard Grade (SG). At the time the ANCYL branded the emailed list as a “faked” attempt to discredit their leader, but a senior source at the department of education confirmed that the digital copy of Malema's results was “genuine”. The email also revealed that Malema, 27, passed matric with Es in Sepedi HG and second language Afrikaans HG, an F in geography HG, D in history SG and a C in second language English HG, the latter being his highest mark. Malema graduated with a  Bachelor of Arts degree in 2016. He will be formally awarded his BA honours degree during a graduation ceremony on Wednesday evening. IOL

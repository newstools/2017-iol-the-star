ANC KwaZulu-Natal deputy secretary Mluleki Ndobe, Umzimkhulu Mayor Mphuthumi Mpabanga and municipal manager Mzweliphansi Skhosana were prevented from going into the Magaqa home. Dlamini Zuma witnessed the protest as she and ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairperson Sihle Zikalala were at the Magaqa home in Umzimkhulu. The protesters, some of whom told Independent Media that Magaqa was their political mentor, gathered at the deceased’s home carrying placards that were critical of Ndobe, Mpabanga and Skhosana. They said Magaqa was among four councillors in Umzimkhulu who had been killed since last year. They linked the murders to corruption at the municipality, which they described as rife, and they also alleged the killings were linked to the upcoming Harry Gwala regional conference. Addressing Magaqa’s fa-
mily members, friends and angry supporters, Dlamini Zuma said though the shooting of Magaqa in July, and his death at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital in Durban on Monday, were unbearably painful, “let us respect his departure by being disciplined”. “Let us respect him while we are preparing to bury him with the dignity he deserves. Whatever differences need to be discussed, the leadership will discuss it,” she said. ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe told journalists on Tuesday that the political killings were criminal and that law enforcement agencies should act accordingly. “...The Minister of Police (Fikile Mbalula) has been asked to intervene,” Mantashe said. Magaqa is survived by his wife Gugu and their three children, and will be buried in Umzimkhulu on September16. - Additional reporting by Nokuthula Zwane Political Bureau

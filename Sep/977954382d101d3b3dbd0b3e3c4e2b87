Durban - The High Court in KwaZulu-Natal has ruled that the KwaZulu-Natal ANC's 8th elective conference was unlawful. The conference took place in Pietermarizburg in November 2015 and saw the ANC provincial chairperson Sihle Zikalala being elected and replacing former Premier Senzo Mchunu. Judge Jerome Mguni declared the conference unlawful and void and ordered that the respondents in the matter pay the costs for the case. The ANC says it will study the judgment handed down at the Pietermaritzburg High Court which ruled that the KwaZulu-Natal ANC's 8th elective conference was unlawful. 
 
The party's spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the party would first consult various structures before deciding on a decision.     Tuesday's ruling is likely to bring into focus the leadership question in the province with supporters of former Premier Senzo Mchunu likely to call for his reinstatement. Other positions in the provincial executive committee will be impacted. Supporters of Mchunu sang in jubilation outside the court after the ruling.  * This is a developing story Politics Hub

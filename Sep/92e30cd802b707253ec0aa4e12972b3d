Controversial socialite Zodwa Wabantu shared some 'pearls of wisdom' with Nonhlanhla "Skolopad" Qwabe, despite throwing heavy shade the entertainer at the Feather Awards nominations party in Johannesburg on Thursday. According to Skolopad, Zodwa refused to take a picture with her because it "was not good for her brand". "I was sitting behind her (Zodwa) and when I asked if we could take a picture together she refused and said that it was not good for her brand. I don't understand how taking a picture can be wrong but I am not angry with her, I am just confused. I don't have an issue with her, she looked beautiful," Skolopad told TshisaLIVE. Zodwa, however, does not share in Skolopad's affection, and accused her of being an infant in a very fast and unpredictable industry. "I'm not threatened by Skolopad, she is still crawling in this game. We are in a very fast industry and don't know what tomorrow holds for us, so it's time to make money," Zodwa told TshisaLive. "Skolopad forgets that we are ageing and when the opportunity lands on your lap you grab it with both hands. I'm not here to play games but to make money." Both entertainers have made headlines in recent weeks. Earlier this week, Zodwa shared a video of herself skinny dipping on social media, with the caption: "Freedom is knowing kuyafana (all the same) Do you. Don't suffer from bazothini abantu (what will people say) Naked pool. Naked truth. Zodwa Wabantu".

And since both 'divas' are nominated for the same Feather Award, Drama Queen Of The Year, we're sure the 'rivalry' between the two will not end anytime soon.    The Feather Award ceremony is set to go down on 9 November in Midrand.

East London - A Walter Sisulu University student who made headlines for spending over R800 000 from her meal card had to be whisked away by police from fellow students in East London on Monday night who demanded she account for the debacle.
 
This after a press conference organised by Sibongile Mani’s Pan Africanist Student Movement of Azania (Pasma) turned into a chaos after the student movement was apparently denied the venue by WSU.
 
Mani made headlines across the globe after an amount of R14 million was “erroneously” deposited into her meal allowance card. By the time this came to the attention of the public and her Intellimali card blocked, Mani had already spent about R818 000 of the money.      Ilisolezwe

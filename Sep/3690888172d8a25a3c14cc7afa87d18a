Security had to be beefed up in Umlazi and surrounds this week, ahead of infamous gang leader Sandile “Chillies” Bhengu’s funeral. Bhengu was killed in a shootout with police, allegedly after being caught removing a tracker from a stolen vehicle in Umlazi. A memorial service was held for Bhengu in Umlazi on Wednesday, where hundreds gathered to pay their respects. Among them, were members of Bhengu’s family and of a bikers’ club he joined last year. A funeral is expected to be held for Bhengu this weekend. Police reported no incidents yesterday but spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said messages indicating that criminals were gearing up to hijack the vehicles and attack police officials, were circulating on social media. “We will not tolerate people who want to take the law into their own hands and cause panic in our communities,” she said. “We discourage community members from idolising criminals and joining them when they fire shots into the air and ‘spin’ cars, as this inadvertently can lead to the death of bystanders.” Chillies Bhengu joined Amabhubesi Motorcycle Club last year. Members turned out for his memorial in Umlazi on Wednesday. Picture: Doctor Ngcobo Chillies Bhengu joined Amabhubesi Motorcycle Club last year.

He was not fighting the police and posed no threat to them as he never carried a gun,” said Mazibuko. Sandile Mposula of the Amabhubesi Motorcycle Club, of which the deceased was a member, said Bhengu had joined the club last year and had done a lot to assist the community. Mposula said members of the club did not know anything about Bhengu’s alleged criminal activities. The Mercury

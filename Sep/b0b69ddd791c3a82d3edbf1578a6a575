Johannesburg - This Facebook footage was going viral on Thursday morning after a man driving a Porsche Cayenne and a Range Rover were involved in a minor bumper bash on London Road in Alexandra. The two drivers had pulled over in an attempt to exchange contact details to resolve the matter when, to his surprise, the driver of the Range Rover was brutally assaulted by the Porsche driver. The man can be seen walking towards the Range Rover and viciously vandalising the car at all angles. He then begins to attack the driver and throw punches through the window of the vehicle. While all this is happening, witnesses in the vicinity do nothing to assist, but simply observe.  The victim was identified as a 71-year-old in this Facebook Post by defence company Intelligence Bureau SA:  Dozens of commenters on social media have noted that the driver of the Porsche was wearing the corporate shirt of a well-known motor spares supplier and have called upon the owner of the company to take action.

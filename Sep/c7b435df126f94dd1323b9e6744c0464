Johannesburg - Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba says the motion of no confidence filed by the ANC against him proves that the party is struggling to adapt in its new role as opposition in the city.
 
The ANC filed the motion against Mashaba and Council speaker Vasco da Gama on Wednesday and cited the failure to deliver better services to residents as the reason for their removal. 
 
The DA governs the City of Joburg and Tshwane with the help of coalition partners after the ANC failed to retain its majority following the 2016 local government elections. 
 Mashaba said the allegations levelled against him by the ANC were baseless and laid the blame for the city's financial distress on the doors of the ANC when it still governed the city. 
 
Last month former mayor Parks Tau said the city was on the brink of collapse due to financial ruin, under performance and an inflated budget. 
 
But Mashaba has denied this. 
 
"The fact is that this baseless allegation is a smoke screen, aimed at assuming control that would allow the looting to continue once again because change threatens the very survival of the ANC. The truth is after only 13 months we have been able to ensure that change promised begins to take root in our City," said Mashaba. 
 
He listed some of the successes the city has made over the past couple of months such as the establishment of a corruption busting unit, headed by former Gauteng Hawks head Shadrick Sibiya, which has so far uncovered millions lost to corruption. 
 
Mashaba said the DA will fight the motion, which is expected to be heard at the of the month. 
 
"We will fight this motion, as we have all the other efforts that the ANC has undermine the change that residents want and the ANC fears. The past 2 decades have demonstrated the ANC stands against what the people of our City need, this motion represents a continuation of this trend," said Mashaba.

Johannesburg - The body of a six-year-old boy was found hanging in the toilet of the Dorothy Langa Primary School in Zone 2, in Seshego outside Polokwane, Limpopo police said on Tuesday. Spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said the boy was found on Friday afternoon, between 11.30am and 12.30pm. "It is alleged that the deceased, who is a grade one learner at this school, requested to go to the rest room and when he failed to return back to the class, another learner was sent to go and look for him and subsequently that is when this gruesome discovery was made. The deceased was transported to the local clinic where he was confirmed dead on arrival," Ngoepe said. "The motive and circumstances behind this incident are unknown at this stage but the Police investigations including the autopsy will tell. Members of the communities including educators are advised to put child safety first on the basis that their movement and whereabouts must be monitored at all times to prevent this type of incidents to happen." Ngoepe said that investigations continued. The South African Police Service in Limpopo condemned acts of child negligence and poor child safety measures especially at schools, Ngoepe said.

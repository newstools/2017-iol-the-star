This follows its suspension in 2014 following the death of eight antelope. The zoo was accused of not following the correct paperwork. The PAAZAB membership will also allow Johannesburg Zoo to continue being an international member of good standing with the World Association of Zoos and Aquaria (WAZA). City of Joburg member of the mayoral committee for community development Nonhlanhla Sifumba congratulated the zoo for its reinstatement. At the time, the zoo defended itself, stating it was launching an independent investigation. The reinstatement of the zoo’s PAAZAB membership reaffirms JCPZ’s commitment to regulate and improve its professional standards, and its commitment to the code of ethics, she said. This includes: Trade and movement of animals and plants that conform to international conventions and best practices and abide by national and local regulations. Animal husbandry, to ensure the highest standard of veterinary care and housing for all animals in the care of JCPZ. Breeding programmes and processes aligned to the international conventions. Visitors’ safety. Enforcement of the code. “Furthermore, the re-
instatement will enable Johannesburg Zoo to conclude long-standing agreements to acquire new animals and big exhibits from other zoos that are members of WAZA, and to grow its offering to the people of Joburg,” Sifumba said.

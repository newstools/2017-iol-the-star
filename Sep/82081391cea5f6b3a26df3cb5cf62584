This was revealed yesterday at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court, where Sisulu was meant to appear after being charged with the assault of Lerato Sedi last month. In an interview last month, Sedi said the assault occurred after texting Sisulu asking him to send maintenance money for their three-year-old son. He allegedly asked her to come to his home the following morning, where the request escalated into a heated argument. “I went to his home and he asked that we speak on his patio. When
I explained to him what the money
I keep asking for every month was for, he told me that I chose friends over my financial security,” she reportedly said at the time. As the fight intensified, Sisulu apparently slammed a door on Sedi’s arm, which was when she decided to open the charge of assault. At the time, Sisulu denied the attack, telling The Star: “I can confirm that she came to my house for a meeting last Thursday morning. We could not reach an agreement, and this clearly upset her. “I deny the allegations of any kind of assault and am baffled as to how our disagreement on a maintenance issue suddenly turned into an assault claim.” In the statement, sent through Sisulu’s lawyer, Kagisho Setati, Sedi said: “After much reflection, I have decided to withdraw the charge against Shaka Sisulu. “It was a misunderstanding and it is in the best interest of my marriage that we put this matter behind us. “It was never Shaka’s intention to cause me any physical harm,” she added.

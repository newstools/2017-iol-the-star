Despite having a pre-paid meter, her services have been disconnected several times and she lives with constant threats of having her water and electricity terminated. Gloria Lepper, in May 2015, applied for, and paid R2109 for a pre-paid meter. Despite having taken a final reading on the old meter by City Power officials, Lepper continued to be billed by the city on the meter which had been removed. Her pre-paid was working and she was purchasing electricity from Pick *  Pay, for which she has receipts. After numerous complaints, e-mails and visits to city offices, officials made another blunder - they loaded her pre-paid meter number on to her account, replacing her old number, and again started billing her estimates. Her account has now reached more than R15000. At the time she installed her pre-paid meter, her account balance was zero, as she paid the old account in full. “I don’t know what to do anymore. They keep threatening me and putting disconnection notices under my door, but I do not owe them anything - I buy electricity every week, so I refuse to pay them. I battle to walk and don’t know what to do,” she said. The City of Joburg’s revenue department did not respond to a request for comment. @annacox

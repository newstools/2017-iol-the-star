Durban - Tears and alcohol flowed at the memorial service for one of Durban’s most notorious gangsters Sandile “Chillies” Bhengu on Wednesday. The service was characterised by dancing, loud music and motorbikes being revved to the joy of hundreds of people who had gathered at Umlazi’s M section. As the revelry happened inside the hall, SA police and Metro police who were deployed outside kept a close eye on events. Umlazi’s main roads had police searching cars that were suspicious. Bhengu, 36, died last week after being shot by police. He was allegedly caught stealing a car when he was shot. Mbuso Mazibuko, a friend of Bhengu said he saddened by his friend’s death.

Durban - A two-year-old boy discovered the body of his father hanging in a bedroom at their home in Lotusville, Verulam on Wednesday morning. The 27-year-old man, who has two sons aged 2 and 5, is believed to have committed suicide. According to Reaction Unit South Africa's Facebook page, their members were called to the scene in after the child summoned his grandfather, saying he had tried to wake his father several times. Since the family had last seen the younger man when he went to bed at around 10 pm the previous evening, the grandfather went to investigate. He found the younger man hanging from a burglar bar. Medics pronounced the man dead on the scene. The deceased man is believed to be the husband of a woman who committed suicide earlier a month ago, after an argument with her mother-in-law, allegedly over the cleanliness of kitchen cupboards in the family's home. Her body was also found by the couple's young children.
The husband had reportedly been battling depression since his wife's death.

Clive Peedle, managing director of the South African Polo Association, said the vision for the Prince of Wales Polo Cup was to make it one of the premier polo tournaments in Joburg. Chief marketing officer of Liberty Sydney Mbhele said the Polo cup was built on a legacy that has resulted in one of the most prestigious polo tournaments in Africa. With every polo tourney comes the divot stomp, a tradition most recognised in the sport. During halftime spectators are invited to go on the field to socialise and stomp the divots-holes in the ground created during the game by the horses’ hooves. After six chukkas (a period of play of about seven minutes each), the match saw South Africa come out tops winning the game by seven points to six after five minutes of extra time. @mane_mpi
